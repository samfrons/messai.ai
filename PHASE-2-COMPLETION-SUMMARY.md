expect(1.5).toBeValidPowerDensity();
expect(data).toHaveValidExperimentStructure();

// Comprehensive test fixtures
const experiment = createTestExperiment({
  powerDensity: 2.1,
  configuration: { temperature: 30 },
});

// Domain-specific test utilities
testUtils.expectValidBioelectrochemicalData(mfcData);
```
