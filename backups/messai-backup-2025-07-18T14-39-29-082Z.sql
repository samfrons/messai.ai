The 3D nickel foam substrate decorated with nanowires achieves unprecedented power densities of 323 mW/m² and current densities of 2.24 A/m². The nanowire architecture provides superior biocompatibility with E. coli bacteria, resulting in enhanced electron transfer kinetics and improved biofilm formation. The electrode demonstrates a 2.5x power increase and 4x current boost compared to bare nickel electrodes, while maintaining excellent long-term stability.	10.1038/s41598-025-91889-x	\N	\N	2025-01-15 00:00:00	Scientific Reports	15	1	1-12	["microbial fuel cell","nickel silicide","nanowire electrodes","bioelectrochemistry","electron transfer","E. coli","3D electrodes"]	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91889-x	\N	\N	\N	323	12.4	MFC	research-integration	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-17 14:47:54.541	2025-07-17 14:47:54.541	\N	\N

To inhibit cation transport and enhance the stability of power generation, an anion exchange membranes (AEM) was applied in a single‐chamber MFC.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> After 70 days' operation, the power density dropped 29% in the MFC with an AEM (AMFC), smaller than 48% in the MFC with a cation exchange membrane (CMFC). The reason for this difference lay in internal resistance development. Membrane resistance in the AMFC remained the same but that in the CMFC was increased by 67 Ω, and the cathode resistance increase in the AMFC was 54 Ω, while that in the CMFC was 123 Ω. The precipitated cations on the cathode catalyst surface in the CMFC, which accounted for the resistance increase, were up to 84 times larger than that in the AMFC.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> Because of its capacity for inhibiting cations, the AMFC possessed more stable membrane and cathode resistances; thus an enhanced power generation was obtained.

The high pollutant load in landfill leachate has become one of the potential substrates in bio-energy generation by using microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFC integrated with adsorption system has been introduced as an approach to overcome the limitation of stand-alone MFC, which is able to treat the landfill leachate more effectively while simultaneously generating bio-energy. Anode size has been reported to have a significant influence on the power generation of MFC via lab-scale experiments, however the simulation studies on MFC are still limited. This study aimed to develop a simulation model to predict the effect of graphite fiber brush anode size on the performance of a single chamber air-cathode hybrid MFC-Adsorption system, in terms of COD removal and bio-energy generation. The highest power density of 1.33 mW/m2 was achieved with 20% anode brush removed. The highest current generation of 2.37 mA and voltage of 7.11 mV was obtained with the largest anode surface area of 0.1288 m2 and resistance of 2.76 Ω. The highest COD consumption by electrogenic microorganisms was 4.96 x 10-9 Lmol/mg, and predicted to decrease with decreasing anode size. The efficiency of the simulation model could be further improved by incorporating parameters such as charge transfer kinetic at anode and cathode, adsorption effect by activated carbon as well as the substrate and microbial population behaviour. The simulation model developed was significant towards enhancing the bio-energy generation and reducing the cost of MFC for industrial application.	10.33736/bjrst.6163.2024	\N	\N	2024-06-27 22:00:00	Borneo Journal of Resource Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.33736/bjrst.6163.2024	\N	["brush removed","size"]	\N	1.33	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:36:47.917	2025-07-08 18:34:19.757	\N	\N

["Dexter Hoi Long Leung","Yin Sze Lim","Kasimayan Uma","Guan-Ting Pan","Ja-Hon Lin","Siewhui Chong","Thomas Chung-Kuang Yang"]	Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising technology that utilizes exoelectrogens cultivated in the form of biofilm to generate power from various types of sources supplied. A metal-reducing pathway is utilized by these organisms to transfer electrons obtained from the metabolism of substrate from anaerobic respiration extracellularly. A widely established model organism that is capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET) is Shewanella oneidensis. This review highlights the strategies used in the transformation of S. oneidensis and the recent development of MFC in terms of intervention through genetic modifications. S. oneidensis was genetically engineered for several aims including the study on the underlying mechanisms of EET, and the enhancement of power generation and wastewater treating potential when used in an MFC. Through engineering S. oneidensis, genes responsible for EET are identified and strategies on enhancing the EET efficiency are studied. Overexpressing genes related to EET to enhance biofilm formation, mediator biosynthesis, and respiration appears as one of the common approaches.	10.1007/s12010-020-03469-6	33200267	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-020-03469-6	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis","S. oneidensis"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:36:57.985	2025-07-08 18:39:54.107	\N	\N

["Khaled Elmaadawy","Bingchuan Liu","Jingping Hu","Huijie Hou","Jiakuan Yang"]	Over half of century, sanitary landfill was and is still the most economical treatment strategy for solid waste disposal, but the environmental risks associated with the leachate have brought attention of scientists for its proper treatment to avoid surface and ground water deterioration. Most of the treatment technologies are energy-negative and cost intensive processes, which are unable to meet current environmental regulations. There are continuous demands of alternatives concomitant with positive energy and high effluent quality. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were launched in the last two decades as a potential treatment technology with bioelectricity generation accompanied with simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal. This study reviews capability and mechanisms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous removal from landfill leachate through MFC technology, as well as summarizes and discusses the recent advances of standalone and hybrid MFCs performances in landfill leachate (LFL) treatment. Recent improvements and synergetic effect of hybrid MFC technology upon the increasing of power densities, organic and nutrient removal, and future challenges were discussed in details.	10.1016/j.jes.2020.05.005	32819684	\N	2019-12-31 23:00:00	Journal of environmental sciences (China)	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.05.005	\N	\N	["carbon","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:36:56.979	2025-07-08 18:39:56.821	\N	\N

["Payel Choudhury","Uma Shankar Prasad Uday","Tarun Kanti Bandyopadhyay","Rup Narayan Ray","Biswanath Bhunia"]	There is an urgent need to find an environment friendly and sustainable technology for alternative energy due to rapid depletion of fossil fuel and industrialization. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) have operational and functional advantages over the current technologies for energy generation from organic matter as it directly converts electricity from substrate at ambient temperature. However, MFCs are still unsuitable for high energy demands due to practical limitations. The overall performance of an MFC depends on microorganism, appropriate electrode materials, suitable MFC designs, and optimizing process parameters which would accelerate commercialization of this technology in near future.

cmcu7vu2q000m11456y6q8e2k	Performance evaluation of a photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at cathode.	["Arti Sharma","Meenu Chhabra"]	This study reports the use of Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiat the cathode in a photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC). The PMFC produced power and current density of 15.21&#xa0;W&#xa0;m-3 and 39 A m-3, respectively. The specific growth rate of algae culture at the cathode was 0.284&#xa0;day-1. The system achieved COD removal at 73.30% with a Coulombic efficiency of 9.068%. The usability of algae biomass was assessed in terms of its total phenol content (157.69&#xa0;mg GAE/g algae DW), antioxidant activity (IC50&#xa0;=&#xa0;67.07&#xa0;&#xb5;g/ml), total Chlorophyll (18.95&#xa0;mg/g), total Carotenoids (2.40&#xa0;mg/g), and antibacterial properties against known pathogens. Overall, the study's findings suggested thatC. reinhardtiisupports high power output from a PMFC and is highly resourceful in terms of value-added products.	10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125499	34260967	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Bioresource technology	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell","current density","coulombic efficiency"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125499	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:06.051	2025-07-08 11:31:59.493	\N	\N
cmcv90zk3000314fe5yt5xo5l	Nitrifying biocathode enables effective electricity generation and sustainable wastewater treatment with microbial fuel cell	["Hung-Thuan Tran","Dae-Hee Kim","Se-Jin Oh","Kashif Rasool","Doo-Hyun Park","Rui-Hong Zhang","Dae-Hee Ahn"]	<jats:p>Simultaneous organics removal and nitrification using a novel nitrifying biocathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) reactor were investigated in this study. Remarkably, the introduction of nitrifying biomass into the cathode chamber caused higher voltage outputs than that of MFC operated with the abiotic cathode. Results showed the maximum power density increased 18% when cathode was run under the biotic condition and fed by nitrifying medium with alkalinity/NH4+-N ratio of 8 (26 against 22 mW/m2). The voltage output was not differentiated when NH4+-N concentration was increased from 50 to 100 mg/L under such alkalinity/NH4+-N ratio. However, interestingly, the cell voltage rose significantly when the alkalinity/NH4+-N ratio was decreased to 6. Consequently, the maximum power density increased 68% in compared with the abiotic cathode MFC (37 against 22 mW/m2). Polarization curves demonstrated that both activation and concentration losses were lowered during the period of nitrifying biocathode operation. Ammonium was totally nitrified and mostly converted to nitrate in all cases of the biotic cathode conditions. High COD removal efficiency (98%) was achieved. In light of the results presented here, the application of nitrifying biocathode is not only able to integrate the nitrogen and carbon removal but also to enhance the power generation in MFC system. Our system can be suggested to open up a new feasible way for upgrading and retrofitting the existing wastewater treatment plant by the use of MFC-based technologies.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2009.209	\N	\N	2009-04-30 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.209	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.227	2025-07-09 00:56:52.227	\N	\N
cmcuvgzym00q3fcxokxv6nns7	Characterization of Bioelectrochemical Fuel Cell Fabricated With Agriculture Wastes and Surface Modified Electrode Materials	["Subir Paul"]	<jats:p>A bioelectrochemical fuel was fabricated with pretreated and fermented rice husks. The fuel was characterized with variation of process variables by determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) which is a measure of the oxygen equivalent of electrochemically oxidizable organic fuel to produce electrical energy. The electrodes of the cell were made with nanoporous pure Al coated with platinum, platinum-ruthenium, and platinum-ruthenium-carbon. Anodization parameters were optimized by studying E-I characteristics in sulfuric and oxalic acids with variation of concentration and temperature. Pore size on the order of 30–50 nm was obtained by a two stage anodization. The performance of the cell was evaluated by determining open circuit potential, E-I characteristics, polarization studies, and cyclic voltammetry. A steady onload potential of 600–800 mV was obtained with current density on the order of 15–25 mA/cm2. High power density of 10–15 mW/cm2 has been obtained with electrode materials coated with Pt + Ru or Pt + Ru + C. The performance of coating on nanoporous structure was greatly reflected in the polarization studies, which showed a huge reduction of polarization resistance and increase of exchange current density by many times, the effect being more for anode with anodic solution, fermented rice husk, than with cathode with phosphate buffer cathodic solution. The surface morphology examined by SEM, showed nanodeposits of Pt, Pt-Ru, and the presence of carbon like structure. XRD peaks clearly reveal presence of Pt, Pt-Ru, and carbon.</jats:p>	10.1115/1.4005627	\N	\N	2012-03-18 23:00:00	Journal of Fuel Cell Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND wastewater"]	https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4005627	\N	\N	["platinum","Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:24.622	2025-07-08 23:49:26.165	\N	\N

cmcu7vrqr000j11450nmfkkdi	Integration of various technology-based approaches for enhancing the performance of microbial fuel cell technology: A review.	["Kavya Arun Dwivedi","Song-Jeng Huang","Chin-Tsan Wang"]	The conflict between climate change and growing global energy demand is an immense sustainability challenge that requires noteworthy scientific and technological developments. Recently the importance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) on this issue has seen profound investigation due to its inherent ability of simultaneous wastewater treatment, and power production. However, the challenges of economy-related manufacturing and operation costs should be lowered to achieve positive field-scale demonstration. Also, a variety of different field deployments will lead to improvisation. Hence, this review article discusses the possibility of integration of MFC technology with various technologies of recent times leading to advanced sustainable MFC technology. Technological innovation in the field of nanotechnology, genetic engineering, additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, adaptive control, and few other hybrid systems integrated with MFCs is discussed. This comprehensive and state-of-the-art study elaborates hybrid MFCs integrated with various technology and its working principles, modified electrode material, complex and easy to manufacture reactor designs, and the effects of various operating parameters on system performances. Although integrated systems are promising, much future research work is needed to overcome the challenges and commercialize hybrid MFC technology.	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132248	34543899	\N	2021-12-31 23:00:00	Chemosphere	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132248	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:03.028	2025-07-08 18:39:51.818	\N	\N

cmcu7vuup000n11454ne105fd	Enhancing the Performance of Microbial Fuel Cell by Using Chloroform Pre-treated Mixed Anaerobic Sludge to Control Methanogenesis in Anodic Chamber.	["V Tholia","B Neethu","G D Bhowmick","M M Ghangrekar"]	Formation of methane in the anodic chamber of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) indicates an energy inefficiency in electricity generation as the energy required for electrogenesis gets redirected to methanogenesis. The hypothesis of this research is that inhibition of methanogenesis in the mixed anaerobic anodic inoculum is associated with an enhanced activity of the electrogenic bacterial consortia. Hence, the primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate the ability of chloroform to inhibit the methanogenesis at different dosing to enhance the activity of electrogenic consortia in MFC. A higher methane inhibition and hence an enhanced performance of MFC was achieved when mixed anaerobic sludge, collected from septic tank, was used as inoculum after pre-treatment with 0.25% (v/v) chloroform dosing (MFC-0.25CF). The MFC-0.25CF attained a maximum power density of 8.51&#xa0;W/m3, which was more than twice as that of MFC inoculated with untreated sludge. Also, a clear correlation between the chloroform dosing, methane inhibition, wastewater treatment, and power generation was established, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the technique in enhancing power generation in MFC along with adequate biodegradation of organic matter present in wastewater at an optimum chloroform dosing of 0.25% (v/v) to inhibit methanogenesis.	10.1007/s12010-020-03458-9	33196970	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell","power density"]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-020-03458-9	["anaerobic sludge"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:07.058	2025-07-08 18:39:53.797	\N	\N

["Tianwen Zheng","Jin Li","Yaliang Ji","Wenming Zhang","Yan Fang","Fengxue Xin","Weiliang Dong","Ping Wei","Jiangfeng Ma","Min Jiang"]	Bioelectrochemical systems are revolutionary new bioengineering technologies which integrate microorganisms or enzymes with the electrochemical method to improve the reducing or oxidizing metabolism. Generally, the bioelectrochemical systems show the processes referring to electrical power generation or achieving the reducing reaction with a certain potential poised by means of electron transfer between the electron acceptor and electron donor. Researchers have focused on the selection and optimization of the electrode materials, design of electrochemical device, and screening of electrochemically active or inactive model microorganisms. Notably, all these means and studies are related to electron transfer: efflux and consumption. Thus, here we introduce the basic concepts of bioelectrochemical systems, and elaborate on the extracellular and intracellular electron transfer, and the hypothetical electron transfer mechanism. Also, intracellular energy generation and coenzyme metabolism along with electron transfer are analyzed. Finally, the applications of bioelectrochemical systems and the prospect of microbial electrochemical technologies are discussed.	10.3389/fbioe.2020.00010	32083069	\N	2019-12-31 23:00:00	Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00010	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:22.162	2025-07-08 18:39:56.871	\N	\N

However, the treatment efficiency of BES anodes is limited and the anode effluent usually cannot be directly discharged or reused. To enhance the treatment, BES cathodes may be used for additional treatment of selected contaminants. This has been investigated in a number of approaches, which can be grouped into cathode-stimulated treatment and cathode-supported treatment. The former involves electron transfer directly to reduce contaminants like nitrate or dye compounds, while the latter can accomplish contaminant removal by aerobic oxidation, algal growth, production of strong oxidants for advanced oxidation, and/or membrane treatment. This paper aims to provide a concise view and discussion on the cathode-promoted wastewater treatment in BES, analyze challenges pertaining to the cathode treatment, and offer suggestions on the future development of BES for maximized treatment performance.	10.1038/s41545-018-0022-x	\N	\N	2018-12-04 23:00:00	npj Clean Water	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-018-0022-x	["wastewater"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:16.122	2025-07-08 18:40:00.046	\N	\N

Without catalysts and any additional buffer, the MFC produced electricity continuously and the power density reached 1.3 W/m3 at a loading rate of 1.6 kg COD/m3 d. Simultaneously, the COD and the nitrate removal rate were 1.4 kg COD/m3 d and 67 g NO3-N/m3 d, respectively. When the hydraulic retention time was changed from 6 to 0.75 hours, the power density significantly increased from 0.2 to 10.8 W/m3 due to an increase of cathodic potential. When the aeration chamber was removed and the nitrate was injected into the cathode, the power density increased to 3.7 W/m3. At a high recirculation rate of 10 ml/min, the power density and the nitrate removal rate greatly increased to 34 W/m3 and 294 g NO3−-N/m3 d, respectively.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2009.489	\N	\N	2009-08-31 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.489	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.284	2025-07-09 00:56:52.284	\N	\N

["S V Ramanaiah","K Chandrasekhar","Cristina M Cordas","Irina Potoroko"]	Producing food by farming and subsequent food manufacturing are central to the world's food supply, accounting for more than half of all production. Production is, however, closely related to the creation of large amounts of organic wastes or byproducts (agro-food waste or wastewater) that negatively impact the environment and the climate. Global climate change mitigation is an urgent need that necessitates sustainable development. For that purpose, proper agro-food waste and wastewater management are essential, not only for waste reduction but also for resource optimization. To achieve sustainability in food production, biotechnology is considered as key factor since its continuous development and broad implementation will potentially benefit ecosystems by turning polluting waste into biodegradable materials; this will become more feasible and common as environmentally friendly industrial processes improve. Bioelectrochemical systems are a revitalized, promising biotechnology integrating microorganisms (or enzymes) with multifaceted applications. The technology can efficiently reduce waste and wastewater while recovering energy and chemicals, taking advantage of their biological elements' specific redox processes. In this review, a consolidated description of agro-food waste and wastewater and its remediation possibilities, using different bioelectrochemical-based systems is presented and discussed together with a critical view of the current and future potential applications.	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121432	36907238	\N	2023-01-14 23:00:00	Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical","bioenergy"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121432	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:24.177	2025-07-08 18:39:48.658	\N	\N

["Xi Chen","Peng Liang","Xiaoyuan Zhang","Xia Huang"]	Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are integrated water treatment technologies that generate electricity using organic matter in wastewater. In situ use of bioelectricity can direct the migration of ionic substances in a BES, thereby enabling water desalination, resource recovery, and valuable substance production. Recently, much attention has been placed on the microbial desalination cells in BESs to drive water desalination, and various configurations have optimized electricity generation and desalination performance and also coupled hydrogen production, heavy metal reduction, and other reactions. In addition, directional transport of other types of charged ions can remediate polluted groundwater, recover nutrient, and produce valuable substances. To better promote the practical application, the use of BESs as directional drivers of ionic substances requires further optimization to improve energy use efficiency and treatment efficacy. This article reviews existing researches on BES-driven directional ion transport to treat wastewater and identifies a few key factors involved in efficiency optimization.	10.1016/j.biortech.2016.02.107	26961714	\N	2015-12-31 23:00:00	Bioresource technology	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.02.107	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MDC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:25.186	2025-07-08 18:40:06.516	\N	\N

["Hui-Xiang Wang","Qi-Wei Peng","Yu-Li Yang","Xi-Wei He","Yi-Jing Yang","Shuai Zhang","Hai-Liang Song"]	Microbial degradation plays a crucial role in removing sulfonamides from soil, enhancing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) remediation. To further augment SMX removal efficiency and mitigate the transmission risk associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), this study proposes a novel approach that integrates micro-animals, microorganisms, and microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. The results showed that earthworm-MFC synergy substantially reduces SMX content and ARGs abundance in soil. The introduction of earthworms enhances humus content, facilitating electron transfer within MFC and consequently improving current generation. Furthermore, electrical stimulation applied to earthworms led to increased protein secretion and enhanced antioxidant system activity, thereby accelerating SMX degradation. Earthworms also foster MFC-associated bacterial growth and SMX-degrading bacteria proliferation, augmenting MFC treatment efficacy. This synergistic effect significantly augmented the overall efficacy of MFC treatment for antibiotics. Overall, integrating earthworm activity with MFC technology effectively optimizes electricity generation and enhances pollutant removal.	10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131442	39241811	\N	2023-12-31 23:00:00	Bioresource technology	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131442	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:28.209	2025-07-08 18:39:46.336	\N	\N

["Burak Kilinc","Dilan Akagunduz","Murat Ozdemir","Aykut Kul","Tunc Catal"]	In this study, the effects of cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, commonly found in wastewater on hydrogen production were investigated using microbial electrolysis cells. Benzoylecgonine dissolved in synthetic urine and human urine containing benzoylecgonine were inoculated to evaluate hydrogen production performance in microbial electrolysis cells. Microbial electrolysis cells were inoculated with synthetic urine and human urine containing the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine for hydrogen gas production performance. Gas production was observed and measured daily by gas chromatography. GC-MS was used to analyze the compounds found in human urine before and after operation in microbial electrolysis cells. The metabolite's pH values and optical density in microbial electrolysis cells were analyzed spectrophotometrically. Hydrogen gas was successfully produced in microbial electrolysis cells (~&#x2009;5.5&#xa0;mL) at the end of the 24th day in the presence of benzoylecgonine in synthetic urine. Human urine containing benzoylecgonine also generated hydrogen in microbial electrolysis cells. In conclusion, microbial electrolysis cells can be used to remove cocaine metabolites from contaminated wastewater generating hydrogen gas.	10.1007/s13205-023-03805-7	37920191	\N	2022-12-31 23:00:00	3 Biotech	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-023-03805-7	["wastewater"]	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:52.393	2025-07-08 18:39:48.944	\N	\N

["Xian-Wei Liu","Wen-Wei Li","Han-Qing Yu"]	Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), in which microorganisms are utilized as a self-regenerable catalyst at the anode of an electrochemical cell to directly extract electrical energy from organic matter, have been widely recognized as a promising technology for energy-efficient wastewater treatment or even for net energy generation. However, currently BES performance is constrained by poor cathode reaction kinetics. Thus, there is a strong impetus to improve the cathodic catalysis performance through proper selection and design of catalysts. This review introduces the fundamentals and current development status of various cathodic catalysts (including electrocatalysts, photoelectrocatalysts and bioelectrocatalysts) in BES, identifies their limitations and influential factors, compares their catalytic performances in terms of catalytic efficiency, stability, selectivity, etc., and discusses the possible optimization strategies and future research directions. Special focus is given on the analysis of how the catalytic performance of different catalysts can be improved by fine tuning their physicochemical or physiological properties.	10.1039/c3cs60130g	23959403	\N	2014-01-20 23:00:00	Chemical Society reviews	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60130g	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:29.217	2025-07-08 18:40:11.447	\N	\N

cmcvagvxt005ddqyul0z7zk1i	Adapting Gas Turbines to Zero Emission Oxy-Fuel Power Plants	["Roger E. Anderson","Scott MacAdam","Fermin Viteri","Daniel O. Davies","James P. Downs","Andrew Paliszewski"]	<jats:p>Future power plants will require some type of carbon capture and storage (CCS) system to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The most promising technologies for CCS are: oxy-fuel (O-F) combustion, pre-combustion capture, and post-combustion capture. This paper discusses the recent work conducted by Siemens Power Generation, Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) and Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) in adapting high temperature gas turbines to use CES’s drive gases in high-efficiency O-F zero emission power plants (ZEPPs). CES’s O-F cycle features high-pressure combustion of fuel with oxygen (O2) in the presence of recycled coolant (water, steam or CO2) to produce drive gases composed predominantly of steam and CO2. This cycle provides the unique capability to capture nearly pure CO2 and trace by-products by simple condensation of the steam. An attractive O-F power cycle uses high, intermediate and low pressure turbines (HPT, IPT and LPT, respectively). The HPT may be based on either current commercial or advanced steam turbine technology. Low pressure steam turbine technology is readily applicable to the LPT. To achieve high efficiencies, an IPT is necessary and efficiency increases with inlet temperature. The high-temperature IPT’s necessitate advanced turbine materials and cooling technology. O-F plants have an abundance of water, cool steam ∼200°C (400°F) and CO2 that can be used as cooling fluids within the combustor and IPT systems. For the “First Generation” ZEPP, a General Electric J79 turbine, minus the compressor, to be driven directly by CES’s 170 MWt high-pressure oxy-fuel combustor (gas generator), has been adapted. A modest inlet gas temperature of 760°C (1400°F) was selected to eliminate the need for turbine cooling. The J79 turbine operating on natural gas delivers 32 MWe and incorporates a single-stage free-turbine that generates an additional 11 MWe. When an HPT and an LPT are added, the net output power (accounting for losses) becomes 60 MWe at 30% efficiency based on lower heating value (LHV), including the parasitic loads for O2 separation and compression and for CO2 capture and compression to 151.5 bar (2200 psia). For an inlet temperature of 927°C (1700°F), the nominal value, the net output power is 70 MWe at 34% efficiency (LHV). FTT and CES are evaluating a “Second Generation” IPT with a gas inlet temperature of 1260°C (2300°F). Predicted performance values for these plants incorporating the HPT, IPT and the LPT are: output power of approximately 100–200 MWe with an efficiency of 40 to 45%. The “Third Generation” IPT for 2015+ power plants will be based on the development of very high temperature turbines having an inlet temperature goal of 1760°C (3200°F). Recent DOE/CES studies project such plants will have LHV efficiencies in the 50% range for natural gas and HHV efficiencies near 40% for gasified coal.</jats:p>	10.1115/gt2008-51377	\N	\N	2007-12-31 23:00:00	Volume 2: Controls, Diagnostics and Instrumentation; Cycle Innovations; Electric Power	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2008-51377	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 01:37:13.649	2025-07-09 01:37:13.649	\N	\N
cmcu7wea6001c1145xn729l0j	Hexavalent chromium waste removal via bioelectrochemical systems - a life cycle assessment perspective.	["Rukayya Ibrahim Muazu","Jhuma Sadhukhan","S Venkata Mohan","Siddharth Gadkari"]	Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) present numerous benefits for the removal and recovery of heavy metals from industrial and municipal wastewater. This study evaluated the life cycle environmental impact of simultaneous hexavalent chromium (Cr(vi)) removal and bioelectricity generation in a dual chamber MFC. Results indicate a global warming potential (GWP) of -0.44 kg carbon dioxide (CO2)-eq. per kg of chromium recovered, representing a total saving of up to 97% in comparison with existing technologies for the treatment of Cr(vi) laden wastewater. The observed savings in GWP (kg CO2-eq.) reduced to 61.8% with the removal of the allocated credits from the MFC system's life cycle. Of all the various sub-systems considered within the chromium waste treatment plant, the MFC unit and the chromium metal recovery unit had the largest impact in terms of GWP (kg CO2-eq.), non-renewable energy use (NREU) (MJ primary), and mineral extraction (MJ surplus). A statistical analysis of the results showed that an increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was associated with a reduction in GWP (kg CO2-eq.), NREU (MJ primary), and terrestrial ecotoxicity (kg triethylene glycol equivalents into soil (TEG soil)-eq.). The life cycle assessment (LCA) output showed a high sensitivity to changes in the materials and construction processes of MFC reactors, indicating the need for further research into sustainable materials for MFC reactor construction. The observed interaction effects of process variables also suggest the need for combined optimization of these variables. Analysis with other types of metals is also important to further demonstrate the practical viability of metal removal through MFCs.	10.1039/d3ew00344b	38013896	\N	2023-01-27 23:00:00	Environmental science : water research &amp; technology	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical","microbial fuel cell","renewable energy"]	https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ew00344b	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","carbon","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:32.239	2025-07-08 18:39:48.483	\N	\N

Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) including microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), integrate three important wastewater treatment options, namely, biological treatment, electrolytic dissociation and electrochemical oxidation/reduction, and are regarded as a new sustainable and effective strategy for treatment of these wastes. The simultaneous and cooperative roles of these multiple units running in parallel in BESs contribute to the efficiency of recalcitrant waste treatment, while substrate metabolism is considered to be a key step triggering different unit operations. An up‐to‐date review is provided on recent research and development in BESs‐based recalcitrant wastes treatment. MFCs and MECs, as two types of BESs, are summarized in terms of treatment efficiency, recalcitrant substance metabolic pathway and microorganism diversity after a brief introduction to the electrochemical process for recalcitrant waste treatment. The scientific and technical challenges that have yet to be faced in the future are also discussed.

["Wanjun Cui","Yaobin Lu","Cuiping Zeng","Jialiang Yao","Guangli Liu","Haiping Luo","Renduo Zhang"]	The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of single-chamber MEC under applied voltages higher than that for water electrolysis. With different acetate concentrations (1.0-2.0&#xa0;g/L), the MEC was tested under applied voltages from 0.8 to 2.2&#xa0;V within 2600&#xa0;h (54&#xa0;cycles). Results showed that the MEC was stably operated for the first time within 20&#xa0;cycles under 2.0 and 2.2&#xa0;V, compared with the control MEC with significant water electrolysis. The maximum current density reached 27.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;A/m2 under 2.0&#xa0;V, which was about three times as that under 0.8&#xa0;V. The anode potential in the MEC could be kept at 0.832&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.110&#xa0;V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under 2.2&#xa0;V, thus without water electrolysis in the MEC. High applied voltage of 1.6&#xa0;V combined with alkaline solution (pH&#xa0;=&#xa0;11.2) could result in high hydrogen production and high current density. The maximum current density of MEC at 1.6&#xa0;V and pH&#xa0;=&#xa0;11.2 reached 42.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.0&#xa0;A/m2, which was 1.85 times as that at 1.6&#xa0;V and pH&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.0. The average hydrogen content reached 97.2% of the total biogas throughout all the cycles, indicating that the methanogenesis was successfully inhibited in the MEC at 1.6&#xa0;V and pH&#xa0;=&#xa0;11.2. With high hydrogen production rate and current density, the size and investment of MEC could be significantly reduced under high applied voltages. Our results should be useful for extending the range of applied voltages in the MEC.	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146597	34030325	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	The Science of the total environment	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146597	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	11.2	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:49.356	2025-07-08 18:39:54.03	\N	\N

The experiment was operated as batch mode at mesophilic condition (35°C) to evaluate continue voltage output using cattle dung as substrate in hydrolysis-acidification process. The results illustrated that electricity generation increased noticeably to 300mV after 3 days operation, reached 430mV after 20 days and stabilized electricity generation from 420mV to 470mV in the following 70 days. The pH decreased from 7.15 to 6.65 after 15 days operation and maintained stability from 6.4 to 6.8. The main components of VFA in anode chamber were acetic, propionic and butiric acids. The dominating VFA was acetic acid that predominated untile day 50 and the maximum propionic acid concentration was 15% of total VFA.	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.113-116.286	\N	\N	2010-05-31 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.113-116.286	\N	\N	["Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:21.791	2025-07-08 18:40:22.418	\N	\N

["Luguang Wang","Fei Long","Dawei Liang","Xiang Xiao","Hong Liu"]	Hydrogen production from renewable resources via microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) is a promising approach for sustainable energy production. Yet high hydrogen yield from real feedstocks has not been demonstrated in up-scaled MECs. In this study, a 10-L single chamber MEC with a high electrode surface area to volume ratio (66&#xa0;m2/m3) was constructed and electroactive cathodic biofilms were enriched for hydrogen evolution reaction. A high hydrogen yield of 91% was achieved using lignocellulosic hydrolysate with a hydrogen production rate of 0.71 L/L/D at an organic loading rate of 0.4&#xa0;g/D. The anodic and cathodic microbial communities, with Enterococcus spp. as the known electroactive bacteria, were capable of achieving current densities of 13.7&#xa0;A/m2 and 16.5&#xa0;A/m2, respectively. A machine learning algorithm was used to investigate the correlation between community data and electrochemical performance, and the critical genera on determining current density were identified.	10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124314	33147527	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Bioresource technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124314	["Enterococcus spp"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:57.432	2025-07-08 11:32:17.624	\N	\N

["Shuyue Ma","Yifan Zhang","Lingli Tu","Xin Li","Xindi Chen","Songwei Lin","Haiping Luo","Xinmin Zhan","Guangli Liu"]	The aim of this study was to develop an efficient strategy for enhancing H2 production in the single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) using food waste leachate as a substrate. Different pH (8.5, 9.5, 10.5, and 11.2), applied voltage (0.8, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4&#xa0;V) and negative pressure control (-50&#xa0;kPa) were tested in the single-chamber MEC. Suitable pH adjustment could greatly promote electricity generation and H2 production rather than negative pressure control. Under pH of 11.5 and 2.4&#xa0;V, the maximum current density reached 121.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.9 A/m&#xb3; with an average H2 concentration of 91.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.2% in a 1.2-L single-chamber MEC within 30 continuous cycles of operation (&#x223c;607&#xa0;h), which was constructed with carbon brushes as the anode and stainless steel brushes as the cathode. The maximum H2 production rate reached 853.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;70.3&#xa0;L/m&#xb3;&#x2022;d with an H2 yield of 26.3&#xa0;mmol&#x2022;H2/g&#x2022;COD. The COD removal of 68.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.8% and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectra of the effluent in the MEC within 21 &#xb1; 3h indicated efficient organics degradation in the leachate. Our results should provide a promising way to enhance the H2 production of MEC during leachate treatment.	10.1016/j.envres.2024.120159	39414112	\N	2024-01-14 23:00:00	Environmental research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.120159	\N	["carbon brush","stainless steel"]	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:55.415	2025-07-08 18:39:45.938	\N	\N
cmcu7wve0001y1145o062y6yv	Hydrogen peroxide production in a pilot-scale microbial electrolysis cell.	["Junyoung Sim","Robertson Reid","Abid Hussain","Junyeong An","Hyung-Sool Lee"]	A pilot-scale dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) equipped with a carbon gas-diffusion cathode was evaluated for H2O2 production using acetate medium as the electron donor. To assess the effect of cathodic pH on H2O2 yield, the MEC was tested with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation exchange membrane (CEM), respectively. The maximum current density reached 0.94-0.96&#x2009;A/m2 in the MEC at applied voltage of 0.35-1.9&#x2009;V, regardless of membranes. The highest H2O2 conversion efficiency was only 7.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.09% for the CEM-MEC. This low conversion would be due to further H2O2 reduction to H2O on the cathode or H2O2 decomposition in bulk liquid. This low H2O2 conversion indicates that large-scale MECs are not ideal for production of concentrated H2O2 but could be useful for a sustainable in-situ oxidation process in wastewater treatment.	10.1016/j.btre.2018.e00276	30197872	\N	2017-12-31 23:00:00	Biotechnology reports (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2018.e00276	["wastewater"]	\N	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	2	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:54.408	2025-07-08 18:40:02.012	\N	\N

Many bacteria can switch between a planktonic form and a biofilm form. The planktonic bacteria have relatively high cell growth and reproduction rates and have a reduced likelihood of survival but can adapt to occupy new habitats. The biofilm state appears to be a natural and predominant state of bacteria. The need for the formation of bacterial biofilm is that it enhances the tolerance of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions, thereby allowing bacteria to avoid being washed away by water flow or the bloodstream by simply attaching to a surface or tissue, and the EPS matrix protects bacteria cells, in deeper layers, against antimicrobial agents, probably by limiting the diffusion of these agents. Biofilm formation steps are initial contact/attachment to the surface, followed by micro-colony formation, maturation and formation of the architecture of the biofilm, and finally detachment/dispersion of the biofilm. Once formed, biofilm restricts bacterial mobility and increases cell density. Secretions of autoinducers into the environment are critical for cross-signaling between bacteria. This cross-talk is called quorum sensing (QS). Quorum sensing is a cell–cell communication mechanism between bacteria that allows specific processes to be controlled, such as biofilm formation and virulence factor expression. Bacterial quorum sensing signaling mainly consists of acyl-homoserine lactones (produced by Gram-negatives), autoinducing peptides (produced by Gram-positives), and autoinducer-2 (produced by both Gram-negatives and Gram-positives). Therefore, this review is aimed at how bacterial biofilms work and are formed.	10.3390/bacteria3030008	\N	\N	2024-06-23 22:00:00	Bacteria	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/bacteria3030008	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:05.496	2025-07-08 18:39:44.527	\N	\N

cmcu7xa5s002h1145rxqnqogi	A modelling study of the spatially heterogeneous mutualism between electroactive biofilm and planktonic bacteria.	["Yuqing Yan","Xin Wang","Anis Askari","Hyung-Sool Lee"]	Microbial cooperation widely exists in anaerobic reactors degrading complex pollutants, conventionally studied separately inside the biofilm or the planktonic community. Recent experiments discovered the mutualism between the planktonic bacteria and electroactive biofilm treating propionate, an end-product usually accumulated in anaerobic digesters. Here, a one-dimensional multispecies model found the preference on acetate-based pathway over the hydrogen-based in such community, evidenced by the fact that acetate-originated current takes 66% of the total value and acetate-consuming anode-respiring bacteria takes over 80% of the biofilm. Acetate-based anodic respiration most apparently influences biofilm function while propionate fermentation is the dominant planktonic bio-reaction. Additionally, initial planktonic propionate level shows the ability of coordinating the balance between these two extracellular electron transfer pathways. Increasing the propionate concentration from 2 to 50&#xa0;mM would increase the steady hydrogen-originated current by 210% but decrease the acetate-originated by 26%, suggesting a vital influence of the planktonic microbial process to the metabolic balance in biofilm. Best strategy to promote the biofilm activity is to increase the biomass density and biofilm conductivity simultaneously, which would increase the current density by 875% without thickening the biofilm thickness or prolonging the growth apparently.	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143537	33272602	\N	2021-01-09 23:00:00	The Science of the total environment	\N	\N	\N	["anode","current density"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143537	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:13.552	2025-07-08 18:39:53.713	\N	\N
cmcu7xbps002j1145vlgp1vvf	Living Bioelectrochemical Composites.	["Samantha R McCuskey","Yude Su","Dirk Leifert","Alex S Moreland","Guillermo C Bazan"]	Composites, in which two or more material elements are combined to provide properties unattainable by single components, have a historical record dating to ancient times. Few include a living microbial community as a key design element. A logical basis for enabling bioelectronic composites stems from the phenomenon that certain microorganisms transfer electrons to external surfaces, such as an electrode. A bioelectronic composite that allows cells to be addressed beyond the confines of an electrode surface can impact bioelectrochemical technologies, including microbial fuel cells for power production and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where microbes produce desired chemicals. It is shown that the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE-K functions as a conductive matrix to electronically connect a three-dimensional network of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to a gold electrode, thereby increasing biocurrent &#x2248;150-fold over control biofilms. These biocomposites spontaneously assemble from solution into an intricate arrangement of cells within a conductive polymer matrix. While increased biocurrent is due to more cells in communication with the electrode, the current extracted per cell is also enhanced, indicating efficient long-range electron transport. Further, the biocomposites show almost an order-of-magnitude lower charge transfer resistance than CPE-K alone, supporting the idea that the electroactive bacteria and the conjugated polyelectrolyte work synergistically toward an effective bioelectronic composite.	10.1002/adma.201908178	32347632	\N	2019-12-31 23:00:00	Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical","microbial fuel cell","electroactive bacteria"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201908178	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis"]	["GO"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:15.568	2025-07-08 18:39:56.925	\N	\N

cmcu7xchr002k11456zl8c99z	Microbial nanowires and electroactive biofilms.	["Gemma Reguera"]	Geobacter bacteria are the only microorganisms known to produce conductive appendages or pili to electronically connect cells to extracellular electron acceptors such as iron oxide minerals and uranium. The conductive pili also promote cell-cell aggregation and the formation of electroactive biofilms. The hallmark of these electroactive biofilms is electronic heterogeneity, mediated by coordinated interactions between the conductive pili and matrix-associated cytochromes. Collectively, the matrix-associated electron carriers discharge respiratory electrons from cells in multilayered biofilms to electron-accepting surfaces such as iron oxide coatings and electrodes poised at a metabolically oxidizable potential. The presence of pilus nanowires in the electroactive biofilms also promotes the immobilization and reduction of soluble metals, even when present at toxic concentrations. This review summarizes current knowledge about the composition of the electroactive biofilm matrix and the mechanisms that allow the wired Geobacter biofilms to generate electrical currents and participate in metal redox transformations.	10.1093/femsec/fiy086	29931163	\N	2017-12-31 23:00:00	FEMS microbiology ecology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy086	["Geobacter"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:16.576	2025-07-08 18:40:01.847	\N	\N

["Xianyue Jing","Shanshan Chen","Xing Liu","Yuting Yang","Christopher Rensing","Shungui Zhou"]	Potassium (K+)-channel-based electrical signaling can coordinate microbial actions at a distance that provides an evolutionary advantage to cell communities. Electroactive cells are usually cultured surrounded by an electric field which provided stronger electrical signaling than the K+-mediated electrical signaling. Whether the K+ signaling also plays a role in coordinating the behavior of electroactive microorganisms has not been accurately demonstrated. Thus, we constructed a K+-channel-deficient strain &#x394;gsuK of Geobacter sulfurreducens to directly investigate roles of K+ signaling in electroactive biofilm formation for the first time. The &#x394;gsuK strain exhibited significantly inferior biofilm formation (i.e., biomass, thickness and component) and consequently showed weaker electrical performance (i.e., start-up time, current output, electrochemical catalytic behavior and charge transfer resistance) than the wild-type strain. Individual electric generation capacity and the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation and electrical performance in the single cell did not significantly change with the deletion of gsuK, indicating that K+ signaling indeed influenced the recruiting behavior of planktonic cell but not the functioning of the single cell related to biofilm formation or electric generation. This study is intended to provide an in-depth understanding of electroactive biofilm formation and serve as a basis for optimizing its electrical performance via strengthening the recruitment behavior.	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158035	35981588	\N	2021-12-31 23:00:00	The Science of the total environment	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158035	["Geobacter","Geobacter sulfurreducens"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:19.598	2025-07-08 18:39:51.847	\N	\N

With the real boiler cleaning wastewater fed as substrate, the maximal removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in AFB‐MFC was up to 90 %, which was higher than the corresponding value of 84 % obtained in the anaerobic biological fluidized bed reactor (ABFBR). The maximum voltage and the maximum power density were 424.6 mV and 18.68 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, respectively, when the external resistance was 5000 Ω. Furthermore, the Haldane inhibition model was well fitted with experiment data (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.97–0.98) in AFB‐MFC/ABFBR. The inhibition of citric acid degradation in ABFBR was stronger than that of AFB‐MFC.

Coulombic efficiencies, however, were greatly reduced due to losses of reducing equivalents to aerobic respiration in the anode chamber. The next challenge will be to optimize the aeration rate of the bacterial culture to balance between maximization of bacterial activation and minimization of aerobic respiration in the culture.

["Soheil Aber","Zhining Shi","Ke Xing","Raufdeen Rameezdeen","Christopher W K Chow","Dharmappa Hagare","Tanu Jindal"]	In view of increasing threats arising from the shortage of fresh water, there is an urgent need to propose sustainable technologies for the exploitation of unconventional water sources. As a derivative of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), microbial desalination cell (MDC) has the potential of desalinating saline/brackish water while simultaneously generating electricity, as well as treating wastewater. Therefore, it is worth investigating its practicability as a potential sustainable desalination technology. This review article first introduces the fundamentals and annual trends of MDCs. The desalination of diverse types of solutions using MDCs along with their life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)&#xa0; and economic analysis is studied later. Finally, limitations and areas for improvement, prospects, and potential applications of this technology are discussed. Due to the great advantages of MDCs, improving their design, building materials, efficiency, and throughput will offer them as a significant alternative to the current desalination technologies.	10.1002/gch2.202300138	37829683	\N	2022-12-31 23:00:00	Global challenges (Hoboken, NJ)	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202300138	["wastewater"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:36.778	2025-07-08 18:39:48.969	\N	\N
cmcu7xtmx00361145qhiqmksr	Remediation of saline-sodic soil by plant microbial desalination cell.	["Xiaoyu Han","Youpeng Qu","Da Li","Ye Qiu","Yanlig Yu","Yujie Feng"]	Saline-sodic soil is widely distributed around the world and has induced severe impacts on ecosystems and agriculture. Plant microbial desalination cell (PMDC) and soil microbial desalination cell (SMDC) were constructed to migrate excessive salt in the soil in this study. Compared with SMDC, PMDCs generated higher voltage ranging from 150&#xa0;mV to 410&#xa0;mV (500&#x3a9;) and the maximum power density reached 34&#xa0;mW/m2. Higher desalinization efficiency was obtained by PMDCs, the soil conductivity reduced from initial 2.4&#xa0;mS/cm to 0.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.1&#xa0;mS/cm and pH decreased from initial 10.4 to 8.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.1. Soils desalination in PMDCs was achieved through multiple pathways, including ion migration in PMDCs driven by electrokinetic process, plant absorption and bioremediation by plant roots and anode microorganism activity. Geobacter was the dominant electrogenic bacteria at the PMDC anode. The electrochemical and desalinating performance of PMDCs was enhanced by plants and provided a new method for remediation of saline-sodic soil.	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130275	33774245	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Chemosphere	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130275	["Geobacter"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	MDC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:38.794	2025-07-08 18:39:53.923	\N	\N

["Yang Cui","Bin Lai","Xinhua Tang"]	The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising environmental biotechnology that has been proposed mainly for power production and wastewater treatment. Though small power output constrains its application for directly operating most electrical devices, great progress in its chemical, electrochemical, and microbiological aspects has expanded the applications of MFCs into other areas such as the generation of chemicals (e.g., formate or methane), bioremediation of contaminated soils, water desalination, and biosensors. In recent decades, MFC-based biosensors have drawn increasing attention because of their simplicity and sustainability, with applications ranging from the monitoring of water quality (e.g., biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), toxicants) to the detection of air quality (e.g., carbon monoxide, formaldehyde). In this review, we summarize the status quo of MFC-based biosensors, putting emphasis on BOD and toxicity detection. Furthermore, this review covers other applications of MFC-based biosensors, such as DO and microbial activity. Further, challenges and prospects of MFC-based biosensors are briefly discussed.	10.3390/bios9030092	31340591	\N	2019-01-22 23:00:00	Biosensors	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/bios9030092	["wastewater"]	\N	["carbon","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:40.813	2025-07-08 18:39:59.589	\N	\N

["Aman Dongre","Nitesh Kumar Poddar","Rakesh Kumar Sharma","Monika Sogani"]	Microbial desalination cells (MDC) are evaluated as an environmentally friendly approach for purifying saline water by using power generated by the decomposition of organic materials in the wastewater. The present study is to evaluate the ferrocyanide-redox and biocathode approach in treating simulated saline water and subsequently recovering bio-electricity using actual domestic reverse osmosis reject water. For the desalination of simulated saline water and domestic reverse osmosis reject water, a three-chamber microbial desalination cell with graphite electrodes and anion and cation exchange membranes was constructed. When treating simulated saline water, the biocathode technique achieved a 5% improvement in salt removal and a 4.9% increase in current and power density when compared to the ferrocyanide-redox approach. When biocathode MDC was used to treat domestic reverse osmosis reject water, a maximum current and power density of 3.81 &#x3bc;A/cm2 and 0.337 &#x3bc;W/cm2, respectively, were recorded, as well as COD removal of 83.9% at the desalination chamber and ions reduction for Na, K, and Ca of up to 79%, 76.5%, and 72%, respectively, in a batch operation for 31&#xa0;days with a stable pH (&#x2248; 7). Thus, the study revealed a microbial desalination cell capable of recovering bioenergy and reducing salt from domestic reverse osmosis reject water with a consistent pH range.	10.1007/s13205-022-03241-z	35845113	\N	2021-12-31 23:00:00	3 Biotech	\N	\N	\N	["bioenergy","membrane","power density"]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-022-03241-z	["wastewater"]	["graphite"]	\N	\N	\N	MDC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:42.838	2025-07-08 11:31:59.515	\N	\N

["Simone Perazzoli","Jos&#xe9; Pedro de Santana Neto","Hugo M Soares"]	Bioelectrochemical systems are emerging as a promising and friendly alternative to convert the energy stored in wastewater directly into electricity by microorganisms and utilize it in situ to drive desalination. To better understand such processes, we propose the development of an anoxic biocathode microbial desalination Cell for the conversion of carbon- and nitrogen-rich wastewaters into bioenergy and to perform salt removal. Our results demonstrate a power output of 0.425 W m-3 with desalination, organic matter removal and nitrate conversion efficiencies of 43.69, 99.85 and 92.11% respectively. Microbiological analysis revealed Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum in the anode (88.45%) and biocathode (97.13%). While a relatively higher bacterial abundance was developed in the anode chamber, the biocathode showed a greater variety of microorganisms, with a predominance of Paracoccus (73.2%), which are related to the denitrification process. These findings are promising and provide new opportunities for the development and application of this technology in the field of wastewater treatment to produce cleaner water and conserve natural resources.	10.2166/wst.2020.134	32385209	\N	2019-12-31 23:00:00	Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.134	["wastewater"]	["(88","chamber"]	["carbon","Cu","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	92.11	MDC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:43.847	2025-07-08 18:39:56.736	\N	\N

cmcu7xyb9003c11454losyvw6	Microbial electrodialysis cell for simultaneous water desalination and hydrogen gas production.	["Maha Mehanna","Patrick D Kiely","Douglas F Call","Bruce E Logan"]	A new approach to water desalination is to use exoelectrogenic bacteria to generate electrical power from the biodegradation of organic matter, moving charged ions from a middle chamber between two membranes in a type of microbial fuel cell called a microbial desalination cell. Desalination efficiency using this approach is limited by the voltage produced by the bacteria. Here we examine an alternative strategy based on boosting the voltage produced by the bacteria to achieve hydrogen gas evolution from the cathode using a three-chambered system we refer to as a microbial electrodialysis cell (MEDC). We examined the use of the MEDC process using two different initial NaCl concentrations of 5 g/L and 20 g/L. Conductivity in the desalination chamber was reduced by up to 68 &#xb1; 3% in a single fed-batch cycle, with electrical energy efficiencies reaching 231 &#xb1; 59%, and maximum hydrogen production rates of 0.16 &#xb1; 0.05 m(3) H(2)/m(3) d obtained at an applied voltage of 0.55 V. The advantage of this system compared to a microbial fuel cell approach is that the potentials between the electrodes can be better controlled, and the hydrogen gas that is produced can be used to recover energy to make the desalination process self-sustaining with respect to electrical power requirements.	10.1021/es1025646	21077623	\N	2010-01-14 23:00:00	Environmental science &amp; technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1021/es1025646	\N	\N	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:44.854	2025-07-08 18:40:23.388	\N	\N

cmcu7xzvb003e11451ty7x790	A state-of-the-art review on microbial desalination cells.	["Lohit Kumar Srinivas Gujjala","Deblina Dutta","Pooja Sharma","Debajyoti Kundu","Dai-Viet N Vo","Sunil Kumar"]	The rapid growth in population has increased the demand for potable water. Available technologies for its generation are the desalination of sea water through reverse osmosis, electrodialysis etc., which are energy and cost intensive. In this context, microbial desalination cell (MDC) presents a low-cost and sustainable option which can simultaneously treat wastewater, desalinate saline water, produce electrical energy and recover nutrients from wastewater. This review paper is focussed on presenting a detailed analysis of MDCs starting from the principle of operation, microbial community analysis, basic architecture, evolution in design, operational challenges, effect of process parameters, scale-up studies, application in multiple arenas and future prospects. After thorough review, it can be inferred that MDCs can be used as a stand-alone option or pre-treatment step for conventional desalination techniques without the application of external energy. MDCs have been used in multiple applications ranging from desalination, remediation of contaminated water, recovery of energy and nutrients from wastewater, softening of hardwater, biohydrogen production to degradation of waste engine oil. Although, MDCs have been used for multiple applications, still a number of operational challenges have been reported viz., interference of co-existing ions during desalination, membrane fouling, pH imbalance and limited potential of exoelectrogens. However, the re-circulation of anolytes with electrodialysis chamber has led to the maintenance of optimal pH for favourable microbial growth leading to improvement in the overall performance of MDCs. In future, genetic engineering may be used for improving the electrogenic activity of microbial community, next generation materials may be used as anode and cathode, varied sources of wastewater may be explored as anolytes, life cycle analysis and exergy analysis may be carried out to study the impact on environment and detailed pilot scale studies have to be carried out for assessing the feasibility of operation at large scale.	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132386	34606888	\N	2021-12-31 23:00:00	Chemosphere	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132386	["wastewater"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MDC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:46.871	2025-07-08 18:39:51.732	\N	\N
cmcu7y0na003f1145m47q3ely	Microbial electrolysis desalination and chemical-production cell for CO2 sequestration.	["Xiuping Zhu","Bruce E Logan"]	Mineral carbonation can be used for CO2 sequestration, but the reaction rate is slow. In order to accelerate mineral carbonation, acid generated in a microbial electrolysis desalination and chemical-production cell (MEDCC) was examined to dissolve natural minerals rich in magnesium/calcium silicates (serpentine), and the alkali generated by the same process was used to absorb CO2 and precipitate magnesium/calcium carbonates. The concentrations of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) dissolved from serpentine increased 20 and 145 times by using the acid solution. Under optimal conditions, 24 mg of CO2 was absorbed into the alkaline solution and 13 mg of CO2 was precipitated as magnesium/calcium carbonates over a fed-batch cycle (24h). Additionally, the MEDCC removed 94% of the COD (initially 822 mg/L) and achieved 22% desalination (initially 35 g/L NaCl). These results demonstrate the viability of this process for effective CO2 sequestration using renewable organic matter and natural minerals.	10.1016/j.biortech.2014.02.062	24632437	\N	2013-12-31 23:00:00	Bioresource technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.02.062	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:47.879	2025-07-08 18:40:12.329	\N	\N

["Benhang Li","Dandan Xu","Li Feng","Yongze Liu","Liqiu Zhang"]	Energy resource scarcity and sediment pollution perniciousness have become enormous challenges, to which research has been focused on energy recovery and recycle technologies to solve both above problems. The organic matter stored in anoxic sediments of freshwater ecosystem represents a tremendous potential energy source. The system of aquatic plant coupled with sediment microbial fuel cell (AP-SMFC) has attracted much attention as a more feasible, economical and eco-friendly way to remediate sediment and surface water and generate electricity. However, the research on AP-SMFC has only been carried out in the last decade, and relevant studies have not been well summarized. In this review, the advances and prospects on AP-SMFC were systematically introduced. Firstly, the annual publication counts and keywords co-occurrence cluster of AP-SMFC were identified and visualized by resorting to the CiteSpace software, and the result showed that the research on AP-SMFC increased significantly in the last decade on the whole and will continue to increase. The bibliometric results provided valuable references and information on potential research directions for future studies. And then, the research progress and reaction mechanism of AP-SMFC were systematically described. Thirdly, the performance of AP-SMFC, including nutrients removal, organic contaminants removal, and electricity generation, was systematically summarized. AP-SMFC can enhance the removal of pollutants and electricity generation compared with SMFC without AP, and is considered to be an ideal technology for pollutants removal and resource recovery. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives were summarized and prospected. Therefore, the review could serve as a guide for the new entrants to the field and further development of AP-SMFC application.	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118771	35007677	\N	2022-01-14 23:00:00	Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118771	["sediment"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:39:04.002	2025-07-08 18:39:51.27	\N	\N
cmcu98ntg0089jyupsowmznx5	A systems approach to scale-up for population health improvement	["Harriet Koorts","Harry Rutter"]	AbstractDespite a number of important global public health successes, for many health behaviours there is a continued lack of interventions that have been sufficiently scaled up to achieve system-wide integration. This has limited sustainable and equitable population health improvement. Systems change plays a major role in the relation between implementation processes and at-scale institutionalisation of public health interventions. However, in research, systems approaches remain underutilised in scaling up. Public health scale-up models have typically centred on intervention replication through linear expansion. In this paper, we discuss current conceptualisations and approaches used when scaling up in public health, and propose a new perspective on scaling that shifts attention away from the intervention to focus instead on achieving the desired population-level health outcomes. In our view, ‘scaling up’ exists on a continuum. At one end, effective scaling can involve a linear, intervention-orientated expansive approach that prioritises the spread of evidence-based interventions into existing systems in order to drive expansion in the application of that intervention. At the other end, we contend that scale-up can sit within a complex systems paradigm in which interventions are conceptualised as events in systems. In this case, implementation and scale-up activities should focus on generating changes within the system itself to achieve the desired outcome. This we refer to as ‘systems-orientated scale-up’ to achieving population health improvement, which can complement traditional approaches in relevant situations. We argue that for some health behaviours, our proposed approach towards scaling up could enhance intervention implementation, sustainability and population health impact.	10.1186/s12961-021-00679-0	\N	\N	2021-12-01 00:00:00	Health Research Policy and Systems	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00679-0	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.085	2025-07-08 18:39:51.975	\N	\N

Weber","Nemanja Danilovic"]	<jats:p>With a growing demand for electricity, clean hydrogen production and usage can be an asset not only to mitigate emissions but for long-term energy storage as well. Hydrogen gas, a high-density energy carrier, can be made through electrolysis in charging mode and generate electricity via a fuel cell in discharging mode in a unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC). While URFCs reduce cost by combining the charging and discharging modes into a singular device, switching between modes becomes burdensome, and water management is a major challenge. One way to mitigate these issues is to operate the entire system in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase operation simplifies the physics of the system but will introduce losses within the system, primarily ohmic and mass transport during the charging mode. In this study, we explore the performance of a Proton-Exchange-Membrane (PEM)-URFC under vapor-phase conditions and the impact of different PEMs, feed gases, and relative humidity on the performance and durability. By tailoring operating conditions and membrane, the vapor-URFC achieves a roundtrip efficiency of 42% and a lifetime of 50,000 accelerated stress test cycles for fully humidified feeds. Discussion of vapor-URFC for energy storage and extensions to look at various applications shows the promise of this technology.</jats:p>	10.1149/1945-7111/ac6c51	\N	\N	2022-04-30 22:00:00	Journal of The Electrochemical Society	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ac6c51	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.594	2025-07-09 00:56:52.594	\N	\N

["Lili Chen","Xiangjian Zheng","Kun Zhang","Baile Wu","Xu Pei","Weisong Chen","Xiaoli Wei","Zifeng Luo","Yongtao Li","Zhen Zhang"]	Nitrate addition is a biostimulation technique that can improve both the oxidation of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) through autotrophic denitrification and the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via heterotrophic denitrification. However, during the remediation, parts of the dissolved nitrate in the sediment migrates from the sediment to the overlying water, leading to the loss of effective electron acceptor. To overcome this limitation, a combined approached was proposed, which involved nitrocellulose addition and a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Results indicated the nitrate could be slowly released and maintained at a higher concentration over long term. In the combined system, the removal efficiencies of PAHs and AVS were 71.56% and 89.76%, respectively. Furthermore, the voltage attained for the MFC-nitrocellulose treatment was maintained at 146.1&#xa0;mV on Day 70, which was 5.37 times higher than that of the MFC-calcium nitrate treatment. Sediments with nitrocellulose resulted in lower levels of nitrate and ammonium in the overlying water. Metagenomic results revealed that the combined technology improved the expression of nitrogen-cycling genes. The introduction of MFC inhibited sulfide regeneration during incubation by suppressing the enzyme activity like EC4.4.1.2. The enhanced biostimulation provided potential for in-situ bioremediation utilizing MFC coupled with slow-released nitrate (i.e., nitrocellulose) treatment.	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131610	37201276	\N	2023-01-04 23:00:00	Journal of hazardous materials	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell","voltage"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131610	["sediment"]	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:39:09.039	2025-07-08 18:39:48.736	\N	\N

["Jimmy Kuo","Daniel Liu","Chorng-Horng Lin"]	Sediment microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were developed in which the complex substrates present in the sediment could be oxidized by microbes for electron production. In this study, the functional prediction of microbial communities of anode-associated soils in sediment MFCs was investigated based on 16S rRNA genes. Four computational approaches, including BugBase, Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX), the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2), and Tax4Fun2, were applied. A total of 67, 9, 37, and 38 functional features were statistically significant. Among these functional groups, the function related to the generation of precursor metabolites and energy was the only one included in all four computational methods, and the sum total of the proportion was 93.54%. The metabolism of cofactor, carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis was included in the three methods, and the sum total of the proportion was 29.94%. The results suggested that the microbial communities usually contribute to energy metabolism, or the metabolism of cofactor, carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis might reveal the functional status in the anode of sediment MFCs.	10.3390/bioengineering10020199	36829693	\N	2023-01-02 23:00:00	Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10020199	["sediment"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:39:07.028	2025-07-08 18:39:48.762	\N	\N
cmcu7yg76003z1145tbcyq68y	Constructed sediment microbial fuel cell for treatment of fat, oil, grease (FOG) trap effluent: Role of anode and cathode chamber amendment, electrode selection, and scalability.	["Jesada Lawan","Siriwan Wichai","Choopong Chuaypen","Aussanee Nuiyen","Tanapon Phenrat"]	For wastewater treatment, sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) have advantages over traditional microbial fuel cells in cost (due to their membrane-less structure) and operation (less intensive maintenance). Nevertheless, the technical obstacles of SMFCs include their high internal electrical resistance due to sediment in the anode chamber and slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode chamber, which is responsible for their low power density (PD) (0.2-50&#xa0;mW/m2). This study evaluated several SMFC improvements, including anode and cathode chamber amendment, electrode selection, and scaling the chamber size up to obtain optimally constructed single-chamber SMFCs to treat fat, oil, and grease (FOG) trap effluent. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, PD, and electrical energy conversion efficiency concerning theoretically available chemical energy from FOG trap effluent treatment (%ECWW) were examined. Packing biochar in the anode chamber reduced its electrical resistance by 5.76 times, but the improvement in PD was trivial. Substantial improvement occurred when packing the cathode chamber with activated carbon (AC), which presumably catalyzed the ORR, yielding a maximum PD of 109.39&#xa0;mW/m2, 959 times greater than without AC in the cathode chamber. This SMFC configuration resulted in a COD removal efficiency of 85.80&#xa0;% and a %ECWW of 99.74&#xa0;% in 30 days. Furthermore, using the most appropriate electrode pair and chamber volume increased the maximum PD to 1787.26&#xa0;mW/m2, around 1.7 times greater than the maximum PD by SMFCs reported thus far. This optimally constructed SMFC is low cost and applicable for household wastewater treatment.	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131619	34346343	\N	2021-12-31 23:00:00	Chemosphere	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131619	["sediment"]	["activated carbon"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:39:08.034	2025-07-08 18:39:51.703	\N	\N

cmcu98nth008ajyupzcayv3lo	9.G. Workshop: Evaluation of scale-up of health systems interventions: what and how? Lessons for scale-up projects	["",""]	Abstract Objectives Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are a major challenge for health systems across the globe. Although effective interventions for prevention, detection and control exist, these do not reach all people in need, especially the poor and most vulnerable. Scale-up strategies are developed to increase universal access to those interventions, addressing demand-side and supply-side barriers and to facilitate integration in the health system. While there are useful frameworks to conceptualise and operationalise scale-up of NCD interventions, there is a knowledge gap on what and how to evaluate. This session addresses that knowledge gap, presenting evaluation methods for scale-up from four large multi-country research projects. The objectives are: To increase knowledge on four dimensions of scale-up evaluation: 1) contextualisation of methods; 2) implementation evaluation; 3) cost-evaluation and 4) use of health information systemsTo present methods and results of implementation research on NCDs as an example for other chronic diseasesTo illustrate how contextualisation, implementation and evaluation varies across different stages of scale-upTo stimulate learning by experience through small-group discussion with session participants This workshop provides added value through the four coherent presentations combined with small group interactions on the same topics. It allows the audience to link the case study lessons to their own research and wider application. Format Four different elements of scale-up evaluation are addressed: 1) Contextualisation of evaluation methods from a common framework; 2) Implementation evaluation at operational level; 3) Cost-evaluation of NCD interventions; and 4) Large-scale evaluation through routine health information systems (HIS). Case studies from four large-scale Horizon2020 funded research projects in 14 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia will be presented, each case focusing on one dimension. Cross-cutting themes of adaptation and transferability of methods will also be addressed. After the presentations, there will be an interactive session to promote experience-based learning in small-group discussions. Presentations Self-Management Approach and Reciprocal Learning for Type 2 Diabetes (SMART2D)Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (SPICES)Scaling-Up NCD Interventions in South-East Asia (SUNI-SEA)The Scale-Up of Diabetes and Hypertension Care (SCUBY) The presentations will provide the introduction to subsequent small-table discussions, around the following questions: How to measure and monitor implementation and outcome of intervention scale-up?How to generate transferrable lessons from cross-country studies?How to conduct cross-setting evaluation of the effect and cost of NCD interventions? Key messages The global scale-up of NCD interventions calls for robust evaluation methods of effect, implementation and cost. Evaluation methods need to be fit to the country context and health information systems.	10.1093/eurpub/ckaa165.466	\N	\N	2020-08-31 22:00:00	European Journal of Public Health	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa165.466	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.085	2025-07-08 18:39:55.099	\N	\N

Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) analysis revealed high performances of the Fe‐based catalysts compared with that of activated carbon (AC). The FePc supported on Black‐Pearl carbon black [Fe‐BP(N)] exhibits the highest performance in terms of its more positive onset potential, positive shift of the half‐wave potential, and higher limiting current as well as the highest power density in the operating MFC of (243±7) μW cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, which was 33 % higher than that of FePc supported on nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (Fe‐CNT(N); 182±5 μW cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>).

cmcu98nrx0051jyupmpcqwd3u	The Effect of Oxygen Mass Transfer on Aerobic Biocathode Performance, Biofilm Growth and Distribution in Microbial Fuel Cells	["E. M. Milner","E. H. Yu"]	AbstractMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) are a sustainable technology for the direct conversion of biodegradable organics in wastewater into electricity. In most MFCs, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is used as the cathode reduction reaction. Aerobic biocathodes, which use bacteria as biocatalysts to catalyze the cathode ORR, provide self‐sustained, robust and highly active alternatives to chemical catalysts. However, further study of the effect of oxygen mass transfer to the biofilm and cathode materials design is needed. In the current work, two aerobic biocathodes were enriched in half‐cells, and oxygen mass transfer to the biofilm and the biofilm distribution in the porous electrode structure were investigated. It was found that mass transfer of oxygen to the aerobic biocathode was a significant factor affecting cathode ORR, evidenced by a strong correlation between the air flow rate and current. Additionally, it was found that the biofilm penetrates between 20–30% into the porous carbon electrode structure, which is likely due to oxygen mass transfer limitations. The performance of a MFC with biocatalysts at both anode and cathode (64 µW cm−2 peak power at an air flowrate of 1 L min−1) showed strong correlation with air flowrate, confirming the observation in the half‐cell system.	10.1002/fuce.201700172	\N	\N	2018-01-31 23:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201700172	\N	\N	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.03	2025-07-08 18:40:01.635	\N	\N

The high cost of electrode material has been a major concern in practical applications of the PMFC technology, but the present composition of waste materials such as rice husk, mild steel dust along with soil has served as an alternative low‐cost electrode material. Tagetes erecta plant has been used to produce clean and continuous electrical energy in the PMFC. The blending of rice husk has improved the porosity of the ceramic anode. The maximum power density recorded in PMFC with 50% rice husk anode was 1.4 mW/m2 as against 0.26 mW/m2 with the anode without rice husk. High biomass growth in terms of better plant height and higher chlorophyll content was also detected in the PMFC system within 60 working days.	10.1002/fuce.202200074	\N	\N	2022-10-01 00:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.202200074	\N	\N	\N	1400	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.042	2025-07-08 18:39:49.569	\N	\N

cmcuvj2nt022tfcxovpm5cqa2	Perspectives on BIM-Based 3D Printing for Sustainable Buildings	["Orly Talyosef"]	<jats:p>Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also called additive manufacture (AM), is a novel, automated method of printing a structure layer-by-layer directly from a 3D digital design model. Its potential ability to build complex shapes in a less costly and more sustainable manner may revolutionize the construction industry. There are three main 3D printing techniques: (a) contour crafting; (b) concrete printing, and (c) D-shape. As a disruptive technology, 3D printing creates a new market and value network, thus disturbing the established market. Building information modeling (BIM) is a comprehensive management approach encompassing the entire life cycle of the architecture and construction (A&amp;C) process, including architectural planning, geometrical data, scheduling, material, equipment, resource and manufacturing data, and post-construction facility management. By maintaining safety and productivity in large-scale digital processes, BIM is critical to 3D printing’s success in construction. Integrating BIM and 3D printing techniques into A&amp;C can potentially lead to an ecological architectural process that reduces waste and energy inefficiency, and prevents injuries and fatalities on construction sites, while increasing productivity and quality. This paper examines BIM-based 3D printing of sustainable buildings, which may revolutionize the construction industry and contribute to a sustainable environment</jats:p>	10.26351/architext/9/3	\N	\N	2020-12-31 23:00:00	Architext	\N	\N	\N	["\\"3D printing\\" AND bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.26351/architext/9/3	\N	\N	["Pt","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:39:01.433	2025-07-08 23:41:46.949	\N	\N

The ability to assess the entire protein network of a cell at a given spatial or temporal point will have a profound effect upon microbial science as the function of proteins is inextricably linked to phenotype. Whilst such a situation is still beyond current technologies rapid advances in mass spectrometry, bioinformatics and protein separation technologies have produced a step change in our current proteomic capabilities. Subsequently a small, but steadily growing, number of groups are taking advantage of this cutting edge technology to discover more about the physiology and metabolism of microorganisms. From this research it will be possible to move towards a systems biology understanding of a microorganism. Where upon researchers can build a comprehensive cellular map for each microorganism that links an accurately annotated genome sequence to gene expression data, at a transcriptomic and proteomic level.</jats:p><jats:p>In order for microbiologists to embrace the potential that proteomics offers, an understanding of a variety of analytical tools is required. The aim of this review is to provide a basic overview of mass spectrometry (MS) and its application to protein identification. In addition we will describe how the protein complexity of microbial samples can be reduced by gel-based and gel-free methodologies prior to analysis by MS. Finally in order to illustrate the power of microbial proteomics a case study of its current application within the Bacilliaceae is given together with a description of the emerging discipline of metaproteomics.</jats:p>	10.1186/1475-2859-6-26	\N	\N	2007-08-14 22:00:00	Microbial Cell Factories	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial electrolysis cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-6-26	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:59.062	2025-07-08 18:40:29.749	\N	\N

Bacteria naturally form biofilms on traditional electrode surfaces, but materials design can help promote extracellular electron transfer between the bacteria and the electrode within biofilms. This paper will discuss materials strategies for promoting biofilm formation, biofilm maintenance, and extracellular electron transfer within the film, as well as improving the lifetime of microbial bioelectrodes. We will discuss different strategies for biophotocurrent generation versus microbial fuel cells versus shock biosensors, including novel carbon materials, electrode treatments, redox polymers, and biopolymer engineering.	10.1149/ma2019-01/30/1520	\N	\N	2019-04-30 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2019-01/30/1520	\N	\N	["carbon","Cu","Fe"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.061	2025-07-08 18:39:58.647	\N	\N

At the same time, digital transformation studies were included with the development of online data monitoring systems in mass production. After the design studies were carried out with Solidworks, design verification research with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) have been realized.  Solidification, filling-time-temperature analyses, and casting simulation studies of micro and macro shrinkage were carried out using the Anycasting simulation program. Then the intensive use of simulation techniques, the activities that would increase the quality of the product with 3D printers were detailed. The microstructure investigation, chemical analyses, and mechanical tests were performed to prove the positive effect of the 3D printing system. Surface morphology determination results showed that the better outcomes have been obtained from the 3D printing reinforced system. Finally, a unique data monitoring system that could communicate with production equipment for the first time in our country without the need for any external software and license, within the scope of digital industrialization system were explained. With the commissioning of the 3D system, 44.2% increase in efficiency and 33% improvement in quality rates were achieved. The biggest advantage of this system is that the total amount of energy consumed was reduced from 197 mJ to 81 mJ.</jats:p>	10.46519/ij3dptdi.1296247	\N	\N	2023-08-30 22:00:00	International Journal of 3D Printing Technologies and Digital Industry	\N	\N	\N	["\\"3D printing\\" AND bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.46519/ij3dptdi.1296247	\N	\N	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:39:01.283	2025-07-08 23:41:46.974	\N	\N

For AD process understanding and optimization the numerical simulations provide a useful tool. Therefore, in this work, the main attention is focused on the development of an efficient and stable optimization approach. The optimization procedure is coupled with a suitable mechanistically inspired self-developed BioModel. For BioModel calibration, a special procedure was developed which incorporates the used BioModel, a sensitivity analysis, and a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The results of numerical simulation, obtained by the AD of various animal manures in a batch lab-scale bioreactor, confirm the reliability of BioModel and the efficiency of the presented calibration procedure. Furthermore, the results of AD process optimization show that the biogas quantity and quality as well as energy used up for bioreactor heating can be improved essentially when amount of added bacteria, temperature and pH values are optimized properly.	10.24084/repqj21.319	\N	\N	\N	RE&amp;PQJ	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.24084/repqj21.319	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.105	2025-07-08 18:39:39.038	\N	\N

cmcu98nu5009tjyupx3bag12u	Bioreactor Simulation with Quadratic Neural Network Model Approximations and Cost Optimization with Markov Decision Process	["Tamás Koncsos"]	The efficient operation of activated sludge type wastewater treatment plants is an ongoing topic for the utility providers, where electric energy consumption shares are high, giving cca. 30 % of total operational costs. Intervention methods for intensification include fine tuning of aeration settings, sludge removal and the adjustment of recirculation rates. In order to analyze the effects of various process control strategies, activated sludge models (ASM) are used for the purpose of biokinetic modeling. In practice, most model simulators do not incorporate optimization and necessary auto-calibration of the latter, due to high computational demand of timeseries evaluation. In this paper, a new mathematical model is presented, which makes biokinetic simulations suitable for the use in decision support systems. Namely, the ASM model is approximated with a computanional inexpesive quadratic model solution, fed into a set of mass-balance corrected neural networks. Cost optimization is achieved with Markov decision process model. The developed method was illustrated for a case of Hungarian, large wastewater treatment plant. It was proven, the model is able to find better aeration schemes for the plant in aspect of cost of operation and nitrogen removal efficiency. The model can be used to find cost-optimal policies under arbitrary defined conditions. As a benefit, results can be implemented into industrial logic controllers.	10.3311/ppci.14734	\N	\N	\N	Periodica Polytechnica Civil Engineering	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3311/ppci.14734	["activated sludge"]	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.11	2025-07-08 18:39:39.091	\N	\N

In this paper the bioelectrochemical characterization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soybean peroxidase (SBP), belonging to class III of the plant peroxidase superfamily, was studied. The homogeneous reactions between peroxidases and some common redox mediators in the presence of hydrogen peroxide have been carried out by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical characterization of the reactions involving enzyme, substrate and mediators concentrations allowed us to calculate the kinetic parameters for the substrate–enzyme reaction (<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>MS</jats:sub>) and for the redox mediator–enzyme reaction (<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>MM</jats:sub>). A full characterization of the direct electron transfer kinetic parameters between the electrode and enzyme active site was also performed by opportunely modeling data obtained from cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry experiments. The experimental data obtained with immobilized peroxidases show enhanced direct electron transfer and excellent electrocatalytical performance for H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Despite the structural similarities and common catalytic cycle, HRP and SBP exhibit differences in their substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency. Basing on our results, it can be concluded that peroxidase from soybean represents an interesting alternative to the classical and largely employed one obtained from horseradish as biorecognition element of electrochemical mediated biosensors.</jats:p>	10.1002/elan.200900208	\N	\N	2009-10-26 23:00:00	Electroanalysis	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical system\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1002/elan.200900208	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:49.333	2025-07-08 18:40:25.095	\N	\N

This paper studies the effect of operational parameters on the performance of a microbial fuel cell. The effect of length of the anode compartment, inlet acetate concentration, acetate flow rate, temperature, thickness of the membrane and bio-film conductivity on the performance of the fuel cell is modeled. The thickness of the membrane is found to play a very limiting role in affecting the performance of the fuel cell. However, the length of the anode compartment, acetate flow rate and bio-film conductivity are found to play a significant role in the performance of the fuel cell. Model results are compared with experimental data and found to compare well.	10.5599/jese.671	\N	\N	\N	Journal of  Electrochemical Science and Engineering	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.5599/jese.671	\N	["compartment"]	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.152	2025-07-08 18:39:39.214	\N	\N

cmcv86yiv00111yhia70qif3c	The performance of Cu2+ as dissolved cathodic electron-shuttle mediator for Cr6+ reduction in the microbial fuel cell	["Praveena Gangadharan","Indumathi M Nambi"]	<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The study investigates the performance of Cu 2+ as dissolved cathodic electron-shuttle mediator (dcESM) for simultaneous Cr 6+ reduction and electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) at pH 2 and 4 conditions. The dcESM behavior of Cu 2+ on carbon cloth (CC) catalyzes the reduction of Cr 6+ into Cr 3+ at pH 2 by undergoing redox reactions. However, at pH 4, a simultaneous reduction of Cu 2+ and Cr 6+ was observed. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed at pH 2 and 4 to probe the dcESM behavior of Cu 2+ for Cr 6+ reduction on CC electrode. Also, at pH 2, increasing the concentration of Cu 2+ from 50 mg L -1 to 500 mg L -1 favors the Cr 6+ reduction by reducing the reaction time from 108 h to 48 h and improving the current production from 3.94 mA m -2 to 6.24 mA m -2 , respectively. Nevertheless, at pH 4, the efficacy of Cr 6+ reduction and electricity generation from MFC is decreased from 62.91% to 18.21% and 4.42 mA m -2 to 1.10 mA m -2 , respectively, by increasing the Cu 2+ concentration from 50 mg L -1 to 500 mg L -1 . Furthermore, the performance of dcESM behavior of Cu 2+ was explored on carbon felt (CF) and platinum (Pt) electrodes, and compare the results with CC. In MFC, at pH 2, with an initial concentration of 100 mg L -1 , the reduction of Cr 6+ in 60 h is 9.63 mg L -1 for CC, 0.17 mg L -1 for CF, and 51.32 mg L -1 for Pt cathodes. The reduction of Cr 6+ (initial concentration of 100 mg L -1 ) at pH 4 in 120 h is 44.72 mg L -1 for CC, 32.13 mg L -1 for CF, and 70.85 mg L -1 for Pt cathodes. Maximum power densities of 1659 mW m -2 , 1509 mW/m -2 , and 1284 mW/m -2 were achieved when CF, CC, and Pt, respectively were employed as cathodes in the MFC.</p>	10.21203/rs.3.rs-22145/v2	\N	\N	2020-06-14 22:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-22145/v2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:31.208	2025-07-09 00:33:31.208	\N	\N

Wang","F.‐L. Yang"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To improve cathodic efficiency and sustainability of microbial fuel cell (MFC), graphite fibre brush (GFB) was examined as cathode material for power production in biocatalysed‐cathode MFC. Following 133‐h mixed culturing of electricity‐producing bacteria, the MFC could generate a reproducible voltage of 0.4 V at external resistance (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>EX</jats:sub>) of 100 Ω. Maximum volumetric power density of 68.4 W m<jats:sup>–3</jats:sup> was obtained at a current density of 178.6 A m<jats:sup>–3</jats:sup>. Upon aerobic inoculation of electrochemically active bacteria, charge transfer resistance of the cathode was decreased from 188 to 17 Ω as indicated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Comparing investigations of different cathode materials demonstrated that biocatalysed GFB had better performance in terms of half‐cell polarisation, power and Coulombic efficiency (CE) over other tested materials.

cmcu98o1l00nmjyup0tny32x3	Performance Analysis of Biocathode in Bioelectrochemical CO2 Reduction	["Anirudh Bhanu Teja Nelabhotla","Rune Bakke","Carlos Dinamarca"]	Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) biogas upgrading is done via reduction of carbon dioxide to methane through electroactive microbial catalysis. The baseline MES mode of operation showed about a 39% increase in the methane production rate compared to the open circuit mode of operation. MES is capable of producing acetic acid at relatively more negative potential (−0.80 to –0.90 V vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE)) than the potential at which it produces methane (−0.65 V vs. SHE). The optimum pH for enhancing the electroactive acetogens is found to be around 6.8–7.0 while a pH of around 7.0–7.5 enhances the electroactive methanogens performance. The biocathode adaptation test reveals that 45% of the methane was produced through the electrochemical pathway with a coulombic efficiency of 100% while maintaining heterotrophic efficiency above 99%.	10.3390/catal9080683	\N	\N	\N	Catalysts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/catal9080683	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	100	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.378	2025-07-08 18:39:39.295	\N	\N

The effect of polyDADMAC on the adsorption of cellulase onto the cellulose fibers, and the properties of MFC and MFC films are described. The additive improved the adsorption of cellulase onto cellulose fibers. Compared to the control, at an addition level of polyDADMAC of 0.789 ml g−1, the crystallinity, aspect ratio, the specific surface area of MFC and, the elongation at break and tensile strength of MFC films are increased, while the oxygen permeability coefficient of the MFC films is decreased. The optimal conditions for preparation of MFC by cellulase pretreatment were: pulp consistency 10%, cellulase dosage 10 µ g−1, pretreatment time 16 h and 0.789 ml g−1polyDADMAC. In summary, polyDADMAC-assisted cellulase pretreatment enhances the efficiency of the cellulase pretreatment of cellulose fibers and improves the performance of MFC and the MFC films.	10.1515/hf-2017-0152	\N	\N	2018-07-25 22:00:00	Holzforschung	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1515/hf-2017-0152	\N	\N	["Pt","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.303	2025-07-08 18:40:00.809	\N	\N
cmcu98nw300dgjyupeqb80won	Toward universal laws of technology evolution: modeling multi-century advances in mobile direct-fire systems	["Alexander Kott"]	This paper explores the question of whether a single regularity of technological growth might apply to a broad range of technologies, over a period of multiple centuries. To this end, the paper investigates a collection of diverse weapon systems called here the mobile direct-fire systems. These include widely different families of technologies that span the period of 1300–2015 CE: foot soldiers armed with weapons from bows to assault rifles; horse-mounted soldiers with a variety of weapons; foot artillery and horse artillery; towed antitank guns; self-propelled antitank and assault guns; and tanks. The main contribution of this paper is that, indeed, a single, parsimonious regularity describes the historical growth of this extremely broad collection of systems. Multiple, widely different families of weapon systems—from a bowman to a tank—fall closely on the same curve, a simple function of time. This suggests a general model that unites allometric relations (such as Kleiber’s Law) and exponential growth relations (such as Moore’s Law). To this author’s knowledge, no prior research describes a regularity in the temporal growth of technology that covers such widely different technologies and over such a long period of history. This regularity is suitable for technology forecasting, as this paper illustrates with explorations of two systems that might appear 30 years in the future from this writing: a heavy infantryman and a tank. In both cases, the regularity helped lead to nonobvious conclusions, particularly regarding the power of the weapons of such future systems. Furthermore, this result suggests a possibility—and related research questions—that even broader collections of technology families might evolve historically in accordance with what might be called universal laws of technological evolution.	10.1177/1548512919875523	\N	\N	2020-10-01 00:00:00	The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1177/1548512919875523	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	2015	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.18	2025-07-08 18:39:54.765	\N	\N

Paxton"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>3D printing technology has become increasingly popular in healthcare settings, with applications of 3D printed anatomical models ranging from diagnostics and surgical planning to patient education. However, as the use of 3D printed anatomical models becomes more widespread, there is a growing need for regulation and quality control to ensure their accuracy and safety. This literature review examines the current state of 3D printing in hospitals and FDA regulation process for software intended for use in producing 3D printed models and provides for the first time a comprehensive list of approved software platforms alongside the 3D printers that have been validated with each for producing 3D printed anatomical models. The process for verification and validation of these 3D printed products, as well as the potential for inaccuracy in these models, is discussed, including methods for testing accuracy, limits, and standards for accuracy testing. This article emphasizes the importance of regulation and quality control in the use of 3D printing technology in healthcare, the need for clear guidelines and standards for both the software and the printed products to ensure the safety and accuracy of 3D printed anatomical models, and the opportunity to expand the library of regulated 3D printers.</jats:p>	10.1186/s41205-023-00175-x	\N	\N	2023-04-06 22:00:00	3D Printing in Medicine	\N	\N	\N	["\\"3D printing\\" AND bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.1186/s41205-023-00175-x	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:39:00.468	2025-07-08 23:41:47.106	\N	\N

However, often only moderate results observed, with many governing factors have been considered and suggested yet without much systematic evaluation and verification. In this study, CNT‐supported glucose oxidase (CNT–GOx) was examined in the presence of 1,4‐benzoquinone (BQ). The intrinsic Michaelis parameters of the reaction catalyzed by CNT–GOx were found very close to those of native GOx. However, the Nafion entrapment of CNT–GOx for an electrode resulted in a much lower activity due to the limited availability of the embedded enzyme. Interestingly, kinetic studies revealed that the biofuel cell employing such an enzyme electrode only generated a power density equivalent to &lt;40% of the reaction capability of the enzyme on electrode. It appeared to us that factors such as electron and proton transfer resistances can be more overwhelming than the heterogeneous reaction kinetics in limiting the power generation of such biofuel cells.

cmcu98o3g00ozjyupbtyxhs5r	A revolving algae biofilm based photosynthetic microbial fuel cell for simultaneous energy recovery, pollutants removal, and algae production	["Huichao Zhang","Qian Yan","Zhongyi An","Zhiyou Wen"]	Photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) based on algal cathode can integrate of wastewater treatment with microalgal biomass production. However, both the traditional suspended algae and the immobilized algae cathode systems have the problems of high cost caused by Pt catalyst and ion-exchange membrane. In this work, a new equipment for membrane-free PMFC is reported based on the optimization of the most expensive MFC components: the separator and the cathode. Using a revolving algae-bacteria biofilm cathode in a photosynthetic membrane-free microbial fuel cell (RAB-MFC) can obtain pollutants removal and algal biomass production as well as electrons generation. The highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates of the anode and cathode chambers reached 93.5 ± 2.6% and 95.8% ± 0.8%, respectively. The ammonia removal efficiency in anode and cathode chambers was 91.1 ± 1.3% and 98.0 ± 0.6%, respectively, corresponding to an ammonia removal rate of 0.92 ± 0.02 mg/L/h. The maximum current density and power density were 136.1 mA/m2 and 33.1 mW/m2. The average biomass production of algae biofilm was higher than 30 g/m2. The 18S rDNA sequencing analysis the eukaryotic community and revealed high operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Chlorophyta (44.43%) was dominant phyla with low COD level, while Ciliophora (54.36%) replaced Chlorophyta as the dominant phyla when COD increased. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that biofilms on the cathode contained a variety of prokaryote taxa, including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, while there was only 0.23–0.26% photosynthesizing prokaryote found in the cathode biofilm. Collectively, this work demonstrated that RAB can be used as a bio-cathode in PMFC for pollutants removal from wastewater as well as electricity generation.	10.3389/fmicb.2022.990807	\N	\N	\N	Frontiers in Microbiology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.990807	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Ni","biofilm cathode"]	33100	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.444	2025-07-08 18:39:39.682	\N	\N

Goryanin"]	<jats:p>A plug flow multi-electrode bioelectrochemical reactor for wastewater treatment and simultaneous generation of electricity has been developed and its efficiency investigated. It employs a horizontally located anodic zone in which the anodic electrodes comprise porous graphite plates coated with palladium. The aerated immersed cathodic electrodes contain iron(II) phthalocyanine as a catalyst. The parameters of the device were obtained using glycerol and acetate as fuels and anaerobic sludge as an inoculum. The maximal volumetric power and current densities obtained, relative to the total volume of the anodic zone, were: glycerol: 73±1 mA/L; 43±1 mW/L; acetate: 75±1 mA/L; 40±1 mW/L. It was shown that biotransformation of glycerol into volatile fatty acids does not depend on the presence of anodic electrodes in the reaction zone, while acetate degradation takes place only if the reaction zone contains anodic electrodes as a final electron acceptor.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2009.139	\N	\N	2009-06-30 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.139	["anaerobic sludge"]	["graphite"]	["Pt","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:42.432	2025-07-08 18:40:25.82	\N	\N

A sustainable approach feedstock for their production is plant biomass, which is degraded to sugars with the aid of microbes-derived enzymes, followed by microbial conversion of those sugars to biofuels. Considering their global demand, additional efforts have been made for their large-scale production, which is ultimately leading breakthrough research in biomass energy. Metagenomics is a powerful tool allowing for functional gene analysis and new enzyme discovery. Thus, the present article summarizes the revolutionary advances of metagenomics in the biofuel industry and enlightens the importance of unexplored habitats for novel gene or enzyme mining. Moreover, it also accentuates metagenomics potentials to explore uncultivable microbiomes as well as enzymes associated with them.	10.3390/genes13111942	\N	\N	\N	Genes	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13111942	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.259	2025-07-08 18:39:39.739	\N	\N
cmcu98nyc00i7jyupfettor29	Harnessing Machine Learning for Metagenomics: Discovering the Invisible Microbial World	["S. Sabaria"]	Metagenomics has revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities by enabling the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Traditional methods of microbiology often miss the vast majority of microorganisms that are unculturable in laboratory settings. Harnessing the power of machine learning in metagenomics provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover the diversity and functionality of these invisible microbial worlds. By analyzing large-scale metagenomic datasets, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and associations that are not easily discernible through conventional analytical techniques, paving the way for new discoveries in microbial ecology and evolution.The integration of machine learning into metagenomics has the potential to enhance the accuracy and speed of taxonomic classification, functional annotation, and the prediction of microbial interactions. Machine learning models can process complex, high-dimensional data, enabling researchers to make more informed predictions about microbial roles in various ecosystems. Additionally, machine learning techniques can aid in identifying novel genes and metabolic pathways that could have significant implications for biotechnology, medicine, and environmental science. These advancements could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as antibiotic resistance, bioremediation, and the development of new bioproducts.As machine learning continues to evolve, its application in metagenomics will likely expand, offering deeper insights into microbial dynamics and their influence on human health and the environment. However, challenges remain, including the need for large, well-curated datasets and the development of models that can handle the complexity and variability of metagenomic data. Despite these challenges, the synergy between machine learning and metagenomics holds great promise for advancing our understanding of the microbial world and unlocking the potential of microbes in various fields.	10.52783/cana.v31.1462	\N	\N	\N	Communications on Applied Nonlinear Analysis	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.52783/cana.v31.1462	\N	["GO"]	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.26	2025-07-08 18:39:39.764	\N	\N

PLA filament, a synthetic polymer derived from corn starch, is generally used in production with the FDM. Although PLA material is recyclable and biodegradable, its carbon emission is not zero. One of the filament types developed to produce more sustainable products is Wood PLA filament materials. This study presents an experimental study examining the effect of printing parameters on the mechanical properties of components produced with Wood PLA filaments. The effects of the printing parameters determined as infill pattern, infill density and nozzle temperature on the mechanical strength parameter determined as tensile strength and bending strength of PLA Wood samples produced in standard sizes were investigated experimentally. The experimental design was carried out in accordance with the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array, and the relationship between the printing parameters and the mechanical strength parameters was modelled mathematically. The estimated strength values calculated using mathematical models were compared with the experimental test results. The results showed that the tensile strength and flexural strength values were directly proportional to the infill density. Experiments have shown that the most effective 3D printing parameter on the mechanical strength parameters is the infill density parameter with a contribution ratio of 63.09% for tensile strength and 73.83% for flexural strength.</jats:p>	10.46519/ij3dptdi.1231076	\N	\N	2023-04-28 22:00:00	International Journal of 3D Printing Technologies and Digital Industry	\N	\N	\N	["\\"3D printing\\" AND bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.46519/ij3dptdi.1231076	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:58.735	2025-07-08 23:41:47.186	\N	\N

A challenge when making MRI-visible objects using 3D printing is that hard plastics are invisible in standard MRI scans, while fluids are not. So typically, a hollow object will be printed and filled with a liquid that will be visible in MRI scans. This poses an engineering challenge however since objects created using traditional Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D-printing techniques are prone to leakage. Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a relatively modern and affordable 3D-printing technique using UV-hardened resin, capable of creating objects that are inherently liquid-tight. When printing hollow parts using DLP printers, one typically requires adding drainage holes for uncured liquid resin to escape during the printing process.

cmcu98nzc00kajyupebnap842	Dynamic and Steady Model Development of Two-Chamber Batch Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)	["Ardiyan Harimawan"]	As an alternative source of renewable energy that has piqued researchers’ interest, Microbial Fuel Cell’s (MFC) limitation of low power density requires further development. Various factors affect the performance, but performing all will be costly and time-consuming. Through a combination of dynamic and steady-state mathematical model modified from past research, effect of microbe types towards dynamic biofilm formation and stead-state OCV can be observed, followed by steady-state simulation to determine maximum power density and its’ corresponding voltage. Similarity with previous research has been observed, with maximum OCV of 838.93 mV achieved by heterotrophic biomass in 75-100 hours with biofilm thickness of 2.087 x 10-4 m, while generating maximum power density of 2050.12 mW//m2 and voltage of 408.16 mV. Lowest OCV value of 838.76 mV was observed in C. sporogenes in 450-475 hours with a biofilm thickness of 2.079 x 10-4 m, while the lowest value of maximum power density was observed in anaerobic microbial communities at 8.48 mW/m2 with voltage of 90.43 mV. Furthermore, it has been observed that variations with higher and lower results in higher stead-state OCV in the shortest amount of time, while increasing power density and its’ corresponding voltage. @font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536869121 1107305727 33554432 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Calibri; panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0cm; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman",serif; mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-ansi-language:IN; mso-fareast-language:IN;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}	10.14710/reaktor.1.1.160-169	\N	\N	2022-02-23 23:00:00	Reaktor	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.14710/reaktor.1.1.160-169	["C. sporogenes"]	\N	["Pt","Fe","Ni"]	8480	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.296	2025-07-08 18:39:50.999	\N	\N

A power density of ∼150 μW cm<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup> was achieved in a full cell, which represented a significant increase from prior reports on yeast‐catalysed fuel cells.

This study synthesized an anode modified with cobalt manganese oxide (MnCo2O4@CF) on carbon felt (CF) by easy hydrothermal method and binder-free. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured with and without diclofenac (DCF). According to SEM results, MnCo2O4 was uniformly dispersed on the anode electrode surface. Moreover, the maximum power density in COD (1000 mg/L), 48 h. condition without DCF (726 mA/m2) was 165 ± 0.012 mW/m2 and with DCF concentration of 20 mg/L, it was 308 ± 0.013 mW/m2 (992 mA/m2). In addition, in the presence of 10 mg/L DCF concentration, the maximum COD removal efficiency was 82% ± 1.93 at 48 h. COD removal efficiency without DCF was 94.67% ± 0.02 at 72 h. After 72 h, the maximum removal efficiency of COD and DCF in the carbon anode was 41% ± 1.15 and 9.5% ± 0.23, respectively. Moreover, the maximum DCF removal efficiency using a MnCo2O4 anode was 56% ± 0.55, at 48 h; the initial COD concentration was 500 mg/L, and the DCF concentration was 20 mg/L. This research showed that coating the anode with MnCo2O4 could lead to the increased growth of microorganisms on the surface of the anode, decreased load transfer resistance, increased power density, and more removal of COD and DCF. As a result, the performance of fuel cells with modified anode and removal of DCF increased compared to anode with CF-MFC. Thus, the performance of fuel cells with modified anode and removal of DCF increased compared to anode with CF-MFC.</jats:p>	10.3390/su142113907	\N	\N	2022-10-25 22:00:00	Sustainability	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/su142113907	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.818	2025-07-09 00:56:52.818	\N	\N

cmcu98o3a00otjyupuj4uwtoy	Increasing power generation and energy efficiency with modified anodes in algae-supported microbial fuel cells	["Necla Altın","Başar Uyar"]	Abstract In this study, an algae-assisted microbial fuel cell (MFC) was developed to both treat horse manure wastewater and generate electricity. Carbon felt (CF) and graphite felt (GF) electrodes were modified with carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and nitric acid (HNO₃) to prepare different anodes and their effects on MFC performance were evaluated. The power density of 59 mW/m2 obtained with the CF-HNO₃ anode showed the highest value among all tested systems and was found to be 2.45 and 2.13 times higher than unmodified CF and GF anodes, respectively. Moreover, a 17% higher performance was achieved compared to the GF-HNO₃ anode. The higher performance of CF-HNO₃ compared to GF-HNO₃ can be attributed to the higher surface area of the carbon felt, improved proton conduction, and increased electrochemical activity after treatment with nitric acid. The modified CF-MWCNT and GF-MWCNT anodes produced power densities of 55 mW/m2 and 45 mW/m2, respectively. The Coulombic efficiency (CE) values obtained were in line with these results. The results reveal that nitric acid modification significantly increases the power output of MFCs by providing accelerated electron transfer on biofilms. This simple and effective method offers a new approach to develop low-cost and high-performance electrode materials for MFCs. Moreover, the analysis of algal biomass from the cathode chamber is in line with the existing literature and makes an important contribution towards sustainable energy solutions. The study stands out as a promising step towards the scalability and commercialization of MFCs. Furthermore, the findings can contribute to economic feasibility through low-cost modification techniques and support environmental sustainability. The findings contribute to economic feasibility and support environmental sustainability through low-cost modification techniques. Future studies can support the wider adoption of MFCs for industrial applications by investigating the effects of these modifications on long-term performance and compatibility with different wastewater types. This could accelerate the transition to sustainable energy solutions by promoting the wider use of MFCs in power generation and wastewater treatment.	10.1007/s13399-025-06536-2	\N	\N	2025-05-31 22:00:00	Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13399-025-06536-2	\N	["carbon felt","graphite","carbon nanotube","CNT","MWCNT"]	["Pt","carbon","iron","Fe","Ni"]	59000	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.439	2025-07-08 18:39:41.838	\N	\N

Lee","K. Yoo"]	In this study, we performed microbial community analysis to examine microbial diversity and community structure in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) seeded with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in South Korea. Because anode-attached biofilm populations are particularly important in electricity transfer, the ecological characteristics of anode-attached biofilm microbes were explored and compared with those of microbes grown in suspension in an anode chamber. 16S rDNA-based community analysis showed that the degree of diversity in anode-attached biofilms was greater than that of the originally seeded activated sludge as well as that of the suspension-grown microbes in the anode bottle. In addition, Bacteroidetes and Clostridia grew preferentially during MFC electricity generation. Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that the anode biofilm populations described in this work are phylogenetically distant from previously characterized MFC anode biofilm microbes. These findings suggest that a phylogenetically diverse set of microbes can be involved in the electricity generation of MFC anode compartments, and that increased microbial diversity in anode biofilms may help to stabilize electricity production in the MFC.	10.2166/wst.2008.577	\N	\N	2008-11-30 23:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2008.577	["activated sludge"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:23.085	2025-07-08 18:40:27.488	\N	\N

The MFC performance is greatly influenced by the anode materials which serve as the support for exoelectrogenic bacteria attachment. In this study, oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) is proposed as an alternative anode material prepared via a direct carbonization process using tube furnace owing to its good conductivity property. The carbonization process was conducted under nitrogen gas flow at 900°C with a constant heating rate of 5°C/min. The anode was prepared by mixing the carbonized OPEFB with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder. When used in MFC, the OPEFB-anode generated a maximum current density of 97.30 mA/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, which is comparatively higher than that of the conventional carbon cloth anode (76.24 mA/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>). Our MFC system had also resulted considerable chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 2-chlorophenol reductions of 77% and 75%, respectively. This study could support future research on freely-available OPEFB materials for high performance MFC anode.</jats:p>	10.1088/1755-1315/765/1/012096	\N	\N	2021-04-30 22:00:00	IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/765/1/012096	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.875	2025-07-09 00:56:52.875	\N	\N

However, in algal fuel cells, photosynthetically evolved oxygen hinders the use of algal biofilms formed at the anode surface. Here, nanostructured bio‐electrochemical systems have been designed to explore the algal bio‐electrochemistry at different illumination and growth conditions.RESULTSThree algal strains were screened for their exoelectrogenic activity and the possibility of direct electron transfer to the chemically modified surfaces. After adjusting light and dark conditions and medium compositions, oxygen production within the fuel cells was regulated. At the anode surface, the obtained bioelectrochemical responses and the morphological characterizations suggested that Oscillatoria agardhii has the potential to serve as electron donor and the nanostructured surface is the final electron acceptor. To that end, dual‐chamber algal fuel cells were constructed and glucose (10 g L–1) was used as carbon source.CONCLUSIONPower density of 26.8 mW m–2 was produced using the biofilm formed by O. agardhii.

In this study, high shear rates were applied to enrich an anodophilic microbial consortium in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Enrichment at a shear rate of about 120 s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> resulted in the production of a current and power output two to three times higher than those in the case of low shear rates (around 0.3 s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Biomass and biofilm analyses showed that the anodic biofilm from the MFC enriched under high shear rate conditions, in comparison with that under low shear rate conditions, had a doubled average thickness and the biomass density increased with a factor 5. The microbial community of the former, as analysed by DGGE, was significantly different from that of the latter. The results showed that enrichment by applying high shear rates in an MFC can result in a specific electrochemically active biofilm that is thicker and denser and attaches better, and hence has a better performance.</jats:p>	10.1111/j.1751-7915.2008.00049.x	\N	\N	2008-10-13 22:00:00	Microbial Biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2008.00049.x	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:41.107	2025-07-08 18:40:27.818	\N	\N

However, using methane in fuel at ambient temperature conditions is quite challenging, due to its high thermodynamically stability. In this present investigation, the feasibility of using methane in the low-temperature microbial fuel-cell (MFC) with an unadulterated culture of Methylococcus chroococcus without the inclusion of any additional electron mediators is investigated. The microbial fuel cell setup was prepared using a salt bridge. Through potentiodynamic study, power density, and OCV, it can be seen that the setup delivers a sufficient amount of voltage and power as the days progress. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic investigations also depict the fact that the cell required roughly one day to balance out, and kept working at full force for up to seven days. This work exhibits the chance of creating power utilizing methane as one of the main carbon sources at ambient temperature with an M. chroococcus unadulterated culture as the direct electron-transporting MFC biocatalyst.</jats:p>	10.3390/cryst11111295	\N	\N	2021-10-25 22:00:00	Crystals	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11111295	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:52.931	2025-07-09 00:56:52.931	\N	\N

Dairy wastewater with a concentration of 2000 mg COD/L was treated in the anode of a batch pMFC. In the cathode chamber, Chlorella vulgaris or Arthrospira platensis was cultivated in synthetic medium, and next in diluted effluent from the anode chamber. The highest power density of 91 mW/m2 was generated by the pMFC with the cultivation of Arthrospira platensis. Higher values of dissolved oxygen remained during the dark phase in the cathodic medium with Arthrospira platensis cultivation than with Chlorella vulgaris. This depletion of oxygen significantly decreased voltage generation, which during the light phase increased again to the maximum values. The COD removal achieved in the anodic chamber was 87%. The efficiency of nitrogen removal in the cathode chamber during the cultivation of Arthrospira platensis and Chlorella vulgaris was about 78% and 69%, respectively. The efficiency of phosphorus removal in the cathode chamber with the cultivation of Arthrospira plantensis and Chlorella vulgaris was 58% and 43%, respectively. This study has shown that the introduction of Arthrospira platensis into the cathode chamber is more effective than that of Chlorella vulgaris.	10.3390/en17102296	\N	\N	\N	Energies	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/en17102296	["Arthrospira platensis","Chlorella vulgaris"]	["chamber"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	91000	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.512	2025-07-08 18:39:40.263	\N	\N

S1 as a biocathode catalyst (BCS1)	["Wenying Li","Yuxiang Liu","Lijie Wu","Ruipeng Ren","Yongkang Lv"]	AbstractBACKGROUNDAn innovative microbial fuel cell (MFC) using Cupriavidus sp. S1 as the biocathode catalyst was developed to improve nitrogen removal from low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) wastewater.RESULTSThe desirable external resistance was 100 Ω in this study, with an optimal total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 95.71%, and a maximum current density and power density of 7583.89 ± 318.11 mA m−3 and 932 mW m−3 at C/N = 2, respectively, which initially confirmed the ability of Cupriavidus sp. S1 to obtain electrons from the electrode. The maximum tolerance of the system at Rext of 100 Ω was C/N = 1, with a TN removal efficiency of 90.87%. Compared with the open circuit, the TN removal increased by approximately 21.60% and 52.02% at C/N = 2 and 1, respectively, which expanded the application area for the dominant denitrifying bacteria S1. Additionally, the system exhibits the obvious merits of less sludge production, low energy consumption and the recovery of some energy.CONCLUSIONBased on these results, domesticated Cupriavidus sp. S1 possesses electrochemical activity. Thus, the system has great potential for efficient and cost‐effective nitrogen removal from nitrate‐containing low C/N wastewater and energy recovery. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry	10.1002/jctb.6309	\N	\N	2020-03-31 22:00:00	Journal of Chemical Technology &amp; Biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/jctb.6309	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.548	2025-07-08 18:39:55.76	\N	\N

Other sources of biofuels are limited and difficult to cultivate therefore microalgae has comes out as an important source of renewable biofuel. Microalgae grow in the presence of sunlight and CO2, and those rich in lipids are excellent source of biofuels (biodiesel) after processing. The present study was aimed at production of biofuel through microalgae route using carbon capture pilot plant and exploring feasibility of scaling-up of bio-fuel production on a mega scale coal fired thermal power plant through analysis and selection of species that can grow in ash-pond area on mass scale.	10.1088/1755-1315/1084/1/012030	\N	\N	2022-09-30 22:00:00	IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1084/1/012030	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.537	2025-07-08 18:39:49.858	\N	\N

Three such MFCs were fabricated with simple straight channels having different channel heights and activated with pure culture anaerobic Geobacter sulfurreducens electroactive biofilm. After the proof-of-principle and correlation between the channel height and electroactive biofilm thickness, we demonstrated improvements on power and current outputs using a fourth design, which featured a high surface area provided by pillars. A high acetate conversion efficiency of more than 80% and low internal resistance of 1.2 kΩ were achieved using the pillar MFC.

cmcu98o8600xkjyup7ipu1vqd	3D Printing of Living MFC Anode	["Megan Carey Freyman","Tianyi Kou","Shanwen Wang","Yat Li"]	3D printing helps to provide further control on electrode design. By using 3D printing to tune the geometry, porosity and dimensions of the structure, mass transport to functional microbes or sites in the structure can be improved. By embedding living microbes directly into the ink we can create 3D printed structures to help harness the activity of microbes and use them in functional devices. Here we demonstrate the incorporation of the living bacteria Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1 (S. Oneidensis MR-1) directly into an ink used for creating 3D printed structures. By incorporating S. Oneidensis MR-1 into a sodium alginate-cellulose ink we showed that S. Oneidensis MR-1 survives the 3D printing process through the prominent degradation of methyl orange azo dye from the surrounding solution in the presence of the living 3D printed structure. The viability was further confirmed using confocal microscopy. By incorporating carbon black into this ink we further demonstrate the direct printing of a living microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode. Electrochemical measurements showed there was good charge transfer between the S. Oneidensis MR-1 and the electrode surface. To our knowledge, this is the first report on implementing 3D printed bacteria structure as a living electrode for an MFC system. The capability of printing living and functional 3D bacterial structure could open up new possibilities in design and fabrication of microbial devices as well as fundamental research on the interaction between different bacterial strains, electrode materials, and surrounding environments.	10.1149/ma2020-01472689mtgabs	\N	\N	2020-04-30 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2020-01472689mtgabs	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis","S. oneidensis"]	["GO"]	["carbon","iron","Fe"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.615	2025-07-08 18:39:55.463	\N	\N
cmcu98o6i00ttjyupy8mxf25w	NAD-Regenerating Biocathode Applied to Electroenzymatic Conversion of Lignin	["Vladyslav Mishyn","David Hickey","Sofiene Abdellaoui"]	Non-renewable and limited fossil resources (i.e. petroleum, coal, and natural gas) have been used over the last years for the production of energy, commodity chemicals, and polymer materials. Nonetheless, the extraction and consumption of these resources leads to deleterious and irreversible environmental impacts. As a sustainable alternative, lignin, one of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass, represents the most promising renewable raw material to produce aromatic-based chemicals and high value-added products. However, the use of lignin as a source of valuable molecules similar to the petroleum-derived chemicals is hindered due to its recalcitrance and structural heterogeneity. Biological approaches have been studied to develop selective and ecofriendly pathways for lignin valorization. It has been reported that some microorganisms can cleave selectively β-ether bonds representing more than a half of lignin bonding pattern.[1] The etherolytic pathway of the soil probacterium Sphingobium paucimobilis, which involves NAD-dependent dehydrogenases and β-etherases, has been well characterized for this purpose.[2] Here we focus on the design of a bioanode combining NAD-regenerating properties and the immobilization of lignin degrading enzymatic cascade to cleave such bonds. We explored the possibility of combing in situ electrochemical regeneration of NAD+ cofactor with a surface immobilized biocatalysts on a single interface. First, we have demonstrated that the electrodes based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified with toluidine blue are capable to regenerate NAD+ cofactor at low potential from its reduced form. This process is essential for dehydrogenases activities. Secondly, we used cross-linked hydrogel of pyrene-modified linear poly(ethyleneimine) to entrap the enzymes on the electrode surface.[3] The obtained bioanode modified with NAD-regenerating catalyst and the multi-enzymatic cascade of Lig enzymes was tested in the presence of guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacylether (GGE), a lignin dimer substrate with β-ether bond, to produce γ-hydroxypropiovanillone (HPV). We believe that such electrochemical systems employing the enzymatic cascade acting like a metabolic funnel with the simultaneous regeneration of the cofactor would permit to refine the heterogeneous mixture of aromatics from lignin depolymerization products into a uniform distribution of value-added compounds.

Keller"]	<jats:p>Microbial fuel cells that can generate energy out of wastewaters are close to pilot scale testing. As such, MFC technology is complementary to methane generation due to the possibility to rapidly convert organic acids, polish effluents and work at low substrate concentrations. The main bottleneck perceived at the moment is the cathodic electron transfer. A variety of catalysts has been investigated for the direct transfer of electrons from the cathode to oxygen in the air. Overlooked in this context were bacteria. Bacteria could indeed be worthwhile to replace chemical catalysts. Moreover, their versatility enables us to not only target at oxygen, but also at nitrous oxides and contaminants as possible drivers of electricity generation, nutrient removal and bioremediation. This paper addresses several recent developments in MFC cathode research, and demonstrates that energy generation is but an aspect of this versatile technology.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2008.103	\N	\N	2008-03-31 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2008.103	\N	\N	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:40.586	2025-07-08 18:40:28.916	\N	\N

Now we are manufacturing the pure hydrogen fuel cell systems for stationary application. This fuel cell systems have some models up to 100kW, and in order to provide the larger electricity than 100kW, the 100kW system can be operated connecting several units up to 1MW.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Toshiba's fuel cell systems have been achieved stable, long-term operation, high durability, and high energy efficiency. These features are realized by internal water management cell stack conflagration using porous carbon bi-polar plates. The porous bi-polar plates can humidify reactant gases supplied as vapor from the surface of the porous bi-polar plates and removes produced water through the porous bi-polar plates by the pressure difference between the reactant gases and the coolant water. This technology realizes ideal conditions in terms of water activity entire active area, suppressing overpotentials due to flooding and temperature and water activity distribution. This technology enables stable continuous operation up to 1 week and design life of 80,000 hours confirmed by demonstration tests, which is one of the highest in the world.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Recent trends in fuel cell development include the growing expectation and demand for higher capacity and long durability fuel cell systems for stationary applications such as carbon neutral complexes and data centers, etc. In addition, demand for high power density fuel cell systems for large commercial mobility vehicles, such as buses and trucks, is also increasing. In order to meet this demand, Toshiba is developing elemental technologies for higher performance fuel cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Development of advanced high performance fuel cells</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to improve cell performance, it is necessary to reduce ohmic, activation, and diffusion polarizations. Among these three overpotentials, a reduction of diffusion polarization is particularly important to achieve operation up to the high current density. To reduce diffusion polarization, the flow field of bi-polar plates must be designed to improve the limiting current density by efficient gas supply to the catalyst layer and to reduce mass transport resistance in the gas diffusion layer and catalyst layer.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Toshiba has focused on reducing this diffusion polarization and is working on the flow field design using numerical simulation.

Figure 1 shows comparison of cell performance between conventional and advanced cells. The limiting current density of advanced cell is 3.6 times larger than that of conventional cell due to simulation-based flow field design and optimization of operating pressure. The application of these development items and optimization of operating conditions reduced each polarization and achieved a current density twice that of conventional cell.

This trend exactly characterizes the current renewable energy production technology. Hence, this review focuses on the improvement of the anode electrode by using different functional metal oxide-conducting polymer nanocomposites to enhance microbial fuel cell (MFC) performance. Enhancement of interfacial bioelectrocatalysis between electroactive microorganisms and hierarchical porous nanocomposite materials could enhance cost-effective bioanode materials with superior bioelectrocatalytic activity for MFCs. In this review, improvement in efficiency of MFCs by using iron oxide- and manganese oxide-based polypyrrole hybrid composites as model anode modifiers was discussed. The review also extended to discussing and covering the principles, components, power density, current density, and removal efficiencies of biofuel cell systems. In addition, this research review demonstrates the application of MFCs for renewable energy generation, wastewater treatment, and metal recovery. This is due to having their own unique working principle under mild conditions and using renewable biodegradable organic matter as a direct fuel source.	10.3389/fnano.2022.876014	\N	\N	\N	Frontiers in Nanotechnology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnano.2022.876014	\N	["polypyrrole"]	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.566	2025-07-08 18:39:40.392	\N	\N
cmcu98o8a00xpjyupkmzmdmi2	A novel fragmented anode biofilm microbial fuel cell (FAB–MFC) integrated system for domestic wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation	["Tesfalem Atnafu","Seyoum Leta"]	Abstract Background The critical MFC design challenge is to increase anode surface area. A novel FAB–MFC integrated system was developed and evaluated for domestic wastewater treatment. It was operated in fed-batch flow mode at 1–3 days of HRT with 755 mg/L CODIN and 0.76 kg-COD/m3/day. The study includes anaerobic-MFC and aerobic-MFC integrated systems. Microbial electrode jacket dish (MEJ-dish) with hybrid dimension (HD) was invented, first time to authors’ knowledge, to boost anode biofilm growth. The treatment system with MEJ+ (FAB) and MEJ− (MFC) anode are called FAB–MFC and MFC, respectively. Results Fragmented variable anode biofilm thickness was observed in FAB than MFC. The FAB–MFC (FAB+) simple technique increases the anode biofilm thickness by ~ 5 times MFC. Due to HD the anode biofilm was fragmented in FAB+ system than MFC. At the end of each treatment cycle, voltage drops. All FAB+ integrated systems reduced voltage drop relative to MFC. FAB reduces voltage drops better than MFC in anaerobic-MFC from 6 to 20 mV and aerobic-MFC from 35–47 mV at 1 kΩ external load. The highest power density was achieved by FAB in anaerobic-MFC (FAB = 104 mW/m2, MFC = 98 mW/m2) and aerobic-MFC integrated system (FAB = 59 mW/m2, MFC = 42 mW/m2). Conclusions The ∆COD and CE between FAB and MFC could not be concluded because both setups were inserted in the same reactor. The integrated system COD removal (78–97%) was higher than the solitary MFC treatment (68–78%). This study findings support the FAB+ integrated system could be applied for real applications and improve performance. However, it might depend on influent COD, the microbial nature, and ∆COD in FAB+ and MFC, which requires further study.

cmcuvg4uj004hfcxo0wmh7j2j	Energy potential of anaerobic digestion of wastes produced in Russia via biogas and microbial fuel cell technologies	["Sergey Kalyuzhnyi"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The well-known use of the microbiological process of anaerobic digestion (AD) to generate biogas (mixture of methane and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is now widely implemented for the production of renewable energy worldwide. In Russia, however, this is not the case despite huge amounts of organic wastes (OW) suitable for AD. This paper firstly inventories major flows of OW from various sectors of the national economy (agriculture, industry, households, etc.) and estimates their biogas potential. Special attention is paid to existing bottlenecks and barriers to implementation of biogas technology given the Russian socioeconomic conditions. The second part of the paper is devoted to a new emerging technology based on AD-microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The current status of research in this field in Russia is reviewed in comparison with worldwide developments. The possible niches for implementation of MFC technology in Russia (e.g., wastewater treatment) are pointed out, including its complements to conventional biogas processes.</jats:p>	10.1351/pac200880102115	\N	\N	2007-12-31 23:00:00	Pure and Applied Chemistry	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1351/pac200880102115	\N	\N	["Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:44.299	2025-07-08 18:40:29.445	\N	\N

Two samples of RTO were synthesized by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) of titanium plates and subsequent electrochemical reduction. Electrochemical performance of CC, BDD, and RTO are tested by performing cyclic voltammetry in the anodic region (0-1V, 50 mV/s), in abiotic and biotic conditions. The surface of colonized materials is observed by SEM microscopy. Results show that bacteria fast settle on all tested material, significantly affecting their electrochemical conductivity. The integration of voltammetric cycles reveals that biofilm generates capacitive effects on the anodic surfaces, particularly evident in RTO, less in CC and absent in BDD. Charge densities provided by capacitive response of RTO and CC are of the order of 5.58 and 0.77 mC/cm2, respectively.	10.1051/e3sconf/202233408009	\N	\N	2022-01-01 00:00:00	E3S Web of Conferences	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202233408009	\N	["carbon cloth","titanium"]	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.592	2025-07-08 18:39:51.404	\N	\N

To achieve that, however, a large amount of data regarding the power required by machinery and their field capacity, together with fuel consumption per hour and per hectare, is needed. This research, based on CAN-bus raw data collected from narrow tractors of 75 kW through a farming management information system (FMIS) system and then processed through a Python package called Vineyardutils created by the authors resulted in a dataset that summarises 374 labelled mechanised operations over a total of 717 working hours. The summary of each operation specifies its type, duration, idle time, speed and engine parameters such as temperature, engine speed, and torque; in addition, the dataset also includes the terrain slope, fuel consumption and size of the working area. As a result, the lowest values of fuel consumption per hour and per area have been estimated for activities such as fertilisation (4.95 ± 1.20 l/h, 3.73 ± 1.48 l/ha), whereas the highest values belong to harvest operations (14.70 ± 3.39 l/h, 11.69 ± 4.68 l/ha); regarding field capacity, values range from 0.54 ha/h for leaf removal to 4.46 ha/h for multirow crop protection. Furthermore, correlations have been found regarding environmental temperature and requested power, with evidence for most of the activities. Future developments can include different tractor engine setups and additional field data.</jats:p>	10.1038/s41598-025-93526-z	\N	\N	2025-03-10 23:00:00	Scientific Reports	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-93526-z	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:34:58.225	2025-07-09 00:34:58.225	\N	\N

It is biologically important for the survival of bacteria in the human intestinal tract. This biological and physiologically important molecule can be used to achieve immobilization of glucose oxidase on nanomaterial modified electrodes. This work focuses on the grafting of pABA on graphene oxide modified carbon fabric electrode. The immobilized enzymes have been used to generate electrons from glucose through direct electron transfer at a potential of -490 mV. Electrochemically deposited reduced graphene oxide was used as the cathode with an oxygen reduction potential of -200mV. The anode and the cathode were inserted into a 3D printed electrode holder with an inter electrode distance of 50mm and an OCV of 107mV was obtained. The compact design of the fuel cell combined with it’ s eco-friendly nature makes this an ideal construction for use as a biolfuel cell.	10.1149/ma2019-04/7/391	\N	\N	2019-06-29 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2019-04/7/391	\N	["graphene","graphene oxide","reduced graphene oxide"]	["carbon","Cu","Fe"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.613	2025-07-08 18:39:58.183	\N	\N

However, their practical application has been limited by low power output and energy conversion efficiency. Research has explored enhancing MFC power output through anode modification and electrode material optimization, with biochar showing potential as an alternative anode material. Our study developed pine cone biochar as an anode for MFCs, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility and significantly improved power generation and degradation performance. FT-IR, contact angle measurements, and electrochemical techniques characterized the MFC performance, with biochar-based MFCs achieving higher voltage, power output, and current density compared to carbon felt. Additionally, biochar MFCs exhibited a higher oil wastewater degradation rate and COD removal efficiency. These findings suggest that biochar is a promising anode material for MFCs, warranting further research to optimize MFC design and operational conditions for effective wastewater treatment and energy recovery.	10.54097/yfhm9v39	\N	\N	\N	Academic Journal of Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.54097/yfhm9v39	\N	["carbon felt"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.63	2025-07-08 18:39:40.738	\N	\N

cmcu98o9x010vjyupex25lurm	Potential of Electricity Generation and Wastewater Treatment of Organic Brewery Effluent Using Inoculated H-Type Microbial Fuel Cell	["Mulu Berhe Desta","Dagmawi Girmay Tebeje","Hagos Mebrahtu Gebrehiwot"]	MFCs are bio-electrochemical devices that are capable of transforming chemical energy stored in waste organic matter into direct electrical energy through catalytic activity of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. Bio-electrochemical systems, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), serve as greener alternatives to conventional fuel energy. In recent years, MFCs have drawn science community interest as a method for direct bioelectricity recovery from wastewater while simultaneously treating the wastewater. Moreover; they gain a competitive advantage over other water treatment technologies due to their unique features such as huge energy benefits, less environmental impact, good operating stability, and high economic efficiency. Reports reveal that MFCs are the subject of much interest to researchers, and the number of papers on MFCs in wastewater treatment is increasing. The ever-growing demand for green waste management and renewable sources of energy has enthused research efforts all over the world. This study, therefore, investigated the effect of process variables on the bio-electrical performance of H-type microbial fuel cells fueled with brewery wastewater and inoculated with distillery plant waste. From the experimental results, 1150mV maximum voltage output, 92.85%, 91.40%, 68.87%, and 70.10% removal efficiencies of COD, BOD, TN and TP respectively were obtained at 35ºC, pH 7, and 5 days. These results confirmed that brewery wastewater effectively treated would generate a considerable amount of direct bio-electricity. Results also revealed that the MFC provides an alternative insight into an effective treatment of wastewater that can simultaneously generate a direct bio-electricity in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner.	10.9734/jenrr/2023/v13i2260	\N	\N	\N	Journal of Energy Research and Reviews	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.9734/jenrr/2023/v13i2260	\N	["GO"]	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	70.1	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.678	2025-07-08 18:39:41.06	\N	\N

However, the low extracellular electron transfer (EET) rates and limited bacteria loading capacity of MFCs anode materials present challenges in achieving high power output. In this study, three-dimensionally heteroatom-doped carbonized grape (CG) monoliths with a macroporous structure were successfully fabricated using a facile and low-cost route and employed as independent anodes in MFCs for treating brewery wastewater. The CG obtained at 900 °C (CG-900) exhibited excellent biocompatibility. When integrated into MFCs, these units initiated electricity generation a mere 1.8 days after inoculation and swiftly reached a peak output voltage of 658 mV, demonstrating an exceptional areal power density of 3.71 W m−2. The porous structure of the CG-900 anode facilitated efficient ion transport and microbial community succession, ensuring sustained operational excellence. Remarkably, even when nutrition was interrupted for 30 days, the voltage swiftly returned to its original level. Moreover, the CG-900 anode exhibited a superior capacity for accommodating electricigens, boasting a notably higher abundance of Geobacter spp. (87.1%) compared to carbon cloth (CC, 63.0%). Most notably, when treating brewery wastewater, the CG-900 anode achieved a maximum power density of 3.52 W m−2, accompanied by remarkable treatment efficiency, with a COD removal rate of 85.5%. This study provides a facile and low-cost synthesis technique for fabricating high-performance MFC anodes for use in microbial energy harvesting.	10.3390/molecules29122936	\N	\N	\N	Molecules	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29122936	["Geobacter"]	["carbon cloth"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.682	2025-07-08 18:39:41.111	\N	\N

Microorganisms were first isolated from the wastewater sample to pure culture and were used as the ‘machinery’ that converts wastewater into energy. The wastewater samples were treated either by sterilization or non-sterilization methods. These tests were run using a modified air-cathode single chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC). By sterilizing the wastewater, the calculated power density was much lower compared to non-sterilized wastewater indicating a significant role of microbial activity in the SCMFC system and substrate availability. Furthermore, mixed culture was observed to give larger power density compared to an individual microbe (18.42 ± 5.84 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for mixed culture and 8.82 ± 4.56 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to 9.46 ± 4.87 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for individual microbe, <jats:italic>Bukholderi capecia and Acidovorax sp</jats:italic>. respectively) to prove that larger power value could be achieved with a mixed microbial system. In addition, the system proved to remove 68.57% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the wastewater sample tested. In conclusion, the designed SCMFC has been proven capable of power generation and wastewater treatment comparable to other SCMFCs to date.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.1113.823	\N	\N	2015-07-12 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.1113.823	["mixed culture"]	\N	["Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:15.449	2025-07-08 23:49:26.48	\N	\N
cmcv9109x000z14feg5am7rdh	Effect of Using Various Cathode Materials  (Carbon Felt, Ni-Co, Cu-B, and Cu-Ag) on the Operation of Microbial Fuel Cell	["Paweł Piotr Włodarczyk","Barbara Janina Włodarczyk"]	<jats:p>Wastewater has high potential as an energy source. Therefore, it is important to recover even the smallest part of this energy, e.g., in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The obtained electricity production depends on the process rate of the electrodes. In MFC, the microorganisms are the catalyst of anode, and the cathode is usually made of carbon material. To increase the MFC efficiency it is necessary to search the new cathode materials. In this work, the electricity production from yeast wastewater in membrane-less microbial fuel cells with a carbon felt, Ni-Co, Cu-B, and Cu-Ag cathodes has been analyzed.  In the first place, the measurements of the stationary potential of the electrodes (with Cu-Ag catalyst obtained by the electrochemical deposition technique) were performed. Next, the analysis of the electric energy production during the operation of the membrane-less microbial fuel cell (ML-MFC). The highest parameters were obtained for the Ni-Co and Cu-Ag catalysts. The cell voltage of 607 mV for Ni-Co and 605 mV for Cu-Ag was obtained. Additionally, the power of 4.29 mW for both cathodes - Ni-Co and Cu-Ag was obtained. Moreover, Ni-Co and Cu-Ag allow the shortest time of COD reduction. Based on the test results (with selected MFC design, wastewater, temperature, etc.), it can be concluded that of all the analyzed electrodes, Cu-Ag and Ni-Co electrodes have the best parameters for use as cathodes in ML-MFC. However, based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that all the tested electrodes can be used as cathode material in MFC.</jats:p>	10.59440/ceer/183171	\N	\N	2024-01-31 23:00:00	Civil and Environmental Engineering Reports	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.59440/ceer/183171	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.157	2025-07-09 00:56:53.157	\N	\N

cmcv910bi001114few05chvv0	Generation of Electricity by Using Microbial Fuel Cell Prototype Fed by Sewage: Case Study at the University of Dar es Salaam	["Mahir M Said","Asia A Saad","Geoffrey R John","Aviti T Mushi"]	<jats:p>The access to electricity is still not reliable in Tanzania. Whilst, there are several locations within the country that have wastewater cites that are not economically used to produce electricity. At the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), there are main grid power, and few scattered solar panels. This study was intended to bridge the divide between the current increasing power demands of the UDSM by exploiting not so much used sources, such as electric energy from wastewater. This study was undertaken to develop a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) prototype fed by sewage in Dar es Salaam, for electricity generation using cost effective materials for the cathode compartment. The collection of samples took place using sewage substrates from the UDSM oxidation ponds. The untreated sewage was collected from oxidation ponds. Preliminary experiments were carried out to identify the cathode and substrate that produced better results in terms of volts and current output. Aluminium produced the most desirable results compared to copper, stainless steel and mild steel in all the substrates. On the other hand, untreated sewage with aluminium/carbon electrodes produced higher voltage and current compared to treated sewage with the same electrodes. Thereafter, a prototype of the MFC was developed by connecting three single chambered cells in series of 628 cm3 volume of untreated sewage with aluminium and carbon electrodes. The prototype generated a stable voltage of 1.73 V and a current of 0.07 mA recorded for a period of one hour. The power generated was enough to light a 6.25 mW LED bulb of 25 mA across a 100 Ω resister. Therefore, untreated sewage produced more power in MFCs with aluminium/carbon electrodes compared to the other tested materials.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Aluminium electrodes, charcoal electrode, alternative energy source, wastewater</jats:p>	10.4314/tjs.v49i1.21	\N	\N	2023-03-30 22:00:00	Tanzania Journal of Science	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4314/tjs.v49i1.21	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.215	2025-07-09 00:56:53.215	\N	\N

Conventional azo dye degradation techniques have drawbacks such as high production and maintenance costs, use of hazardous chemicals, membrane clogging, and sludge generation. Constructed wetland–microbial fuel cells (CW–MFCs) offer a promising sustainable approach for the bio-electrodegradation of azo dyes from textile wastewater. CW–MFCs harness the phytodegradation capabilities of wetland plants like Azolla, water hyacinth, and Ipomoea, along with microalgae such as Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Chlorella, and Anabaena, to break down azo dyes into aromatic amines. These intermediates are then reduced to CO2 and H2O by microalgae in the fuel cells while simultaneously generating electricity. CW–MFCs offer advantages including low cost, sustainability, and use of renewable energy. The valorization of the resulting algal and plant biomass further enhances the sustainability of this approach, as it can be used for biofuel production, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and bio-composting. Implementing CW–MFCs as a tertiary treatment step in textile industries aligns with the circular economy concept and contributes to achieving several sustainable development goals.	10.1093/lambio/ovaf010	\N	\N	2025-02-02 23:00:00	Letters in Applied Microbiology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1093/lambio/ovaf010	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.72	2025-07-08 18:39:42.703	\N	\N

cmcv871gc00431yhimocajbcg	Effect of pH, COD, and HRT on the Performance of Microbial Fuel Cell Using Synthetic Dairy Wastewater	["Aritro Banerjee","Rajnish Kaur Calay","Subhashis Das"]	<jats:p>Microbial fuel cells (MFC) are emerging technologies that can produce electricity while treating wastewater. A series of tests were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of this technology for treating dairy wastewater (DWW). The experiments used Shewanella baltica as an exoelectrogen in a small single MFC to treat simulated DWW. The impacts of various operational factors, specifically pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the influent to the anode chamber, were investigated, and the effect of these variables on the output performance of the cell was evaluated. The best performance of the MFC was found when the pH, HRT, and COD were 8, 6.66 h, and 20,632 mg/L, respectively, in the scaled experimental setup. Under these conditions, the maximum power density and percentage removal of COD in terms of wastewater treatment ability were found to be 138 mW/m2 and 71%, respectively. It may be concluded that MFCs are suitable treatment technologies for treating dairy wastewater while potentially simultaneously generating power.</jats:p>	10.3390/w15193472	\N	\N	2023-09-29 22:00:00	Water	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/w15193472	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:35.004	2025-07-09 00:33:35.004	\N	\N

One of the major factors which contribute to water pollution is insufficiently treated wastewater whereas the depletion of natural resources is due to the dependability of the fossil fuel as the main energy source. Both of these issues show the world urgently required an effective technology of wastewater treatment and energyrecovery. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a treatment method that can achieve the needs of effective treatment of wastewater and energy recovery simultaneously. As mentioned, insufficiently treated wastewater is one of the main causes which contributes to water pollution. Spent caustic wastewater is one of the industrial wastewater that is difficult to be treated, handled and disposed due to its noxious properties. Existing treatment method of treating spent caustic wastewater are limited by low efficiency. However, by applying MFCs, organic and inorganic contaminants are oxidized by biomass and produce electron that is transferred to electrode. The movement of the electron from anode to cathode generate electricity and turns MFC into a treatment method that able to provide both wastewater treatment and energy production.

cmcu98oc8015tjyup7h1aog12	A Potential PES Mechanism for Agroforestry-Led Industrial Wastewater Remediation Using Short-Rotation Trees	["Ram Ranjan"]	Industrial effluents and municipal wastewaters are increasingly finding their way into freshwater bodies, posing serious health and environmental challenges. In this paper, the potential for industrial wastewater remediation through agroforestry is explored for a peri-urban farming region in India. Farmers are incentivized under a payment for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism to convert their farmlands into poplar-based agroforestry and utilize industrial effluents for irrigating trees. Additional income can be derived through sale of poplar timber which enhances the attractiveness of such a PES mechanism. A dynamic optimization model compares farmers’ optimal land use allocation to a socially optimal case. Further, the firm’s effluent discharge outcomes are compared to an alternative arrangement where it is fined for discharging untreated wastewater into waterbodies in the absence of the agroforestry remediation option. Results support the attractiveness of such PES mechanisms in addressing the industrial effluent discharge problem while simultaneously mitigating the effects of water scarcity through wastewater reclamation. The optimal level of tax required to accomplish complete treatment of effluents by polluting firms is several times higher compared to PES payments. Further, the incentive to convert farmland into poplar plantations improves with PES payments but declines with higher profitability of agricultural crops.	10.1142/s2382624x21500065	\N	\N	2021-03-31 22:00:00	Water Economics and Policy	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1142/s2382624x21500065	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.761	2025-07-08 18:39:53.132	\N	\N

Call","C. R. Westgate","S. Choi"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are an alternative electricity generating technology and efficient method for removing organic material from wastewater. Their low power densities, however, hinder practical applications. A primary limitation in these systems is the anode. The chemical makeup and surface area of the anode influences bacterial respiration rates and in turn, electricity generation. Some of the highest power densities have been reported using large surface area anodes, but due to variable chemical/physical factors (e.g., solution chemistry, architecture) among these studies, meaningful comparisons are difficult to make. In this work, we compare under identical conditions six micro/nano‐structured anodes in micro‐sized MFCs (47 μL). The six materials investigated include carbon nanotube (CNT), carbon nanofiber (CNF), gold/poly (ϵ‐caprolactone) microfiber (GPM), gold/poly(ϵ‐caprolactone) nanofiber (GPN), planar gold (PG), and conventional carbon paper (CP). The MFCs using three dimensional anode structures (CNT, CNF, GPM, and GPN) exhibited lower internal resistances than the macroscopic CP and two‐dimensional PG anodes. However, those novel anode materials suffered from major issues such as high activation loss and instability for long‐term operation, causing an enduring problem in creating widespread commercial MFC applications. The reported work provides an in‐depth understanding of the interplay between micro‐/nano‐structured anodes and active microbial biofilm, suggesting future directions of those novel anode materials for MFC technologies.</jats:p>	10.1002/fuce.201400041	\N	\N	2014-09-14 22:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201400041	\N	["carbon paper","GO","carbon nanotube","CNT"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:16.175	2025-07-08 18:40:09.595	\N	\N

Herein, we developed two types of MFC sensors, adapted with sodium acetate (MFC-A) and glucose (MFC-B) as organic substrates in the startup period. An evident difference in the sensor sensitivities (the slope value of the linear-regression curve) was observed between MFC-A and MFC-B. MFC-A exhibited a superior performance compared with MFC-B in the detection of sodium acetate (4868.9 vs. 2202 mV/(g/L), respectively) and glucose (3895.5 vs. 3192.9 mV/(g/L), respectively). To further compare these two MFC sensors, the electrochemical performances were evaluated, and MFC-A exhibited a higher output voltage and power density (593.76 mV and 129.81 ± 4.10 mW/m2, respectively) than MFC-B (484.08 mV and 116.21 ± 1.81 mW/m2, respectively). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and microbial-community analysis were also performed, and the results showed a richer anode biomass of MFC-A in comparison with MFC-B. By utilizing the different sensitivities of the two MFC sensors towards sodium acetate and glucose, we proposed and verified a novel method for a simultaneous test on the individual concentrations of sodium acetate and glucose in a mixed solution. Linear equations of the two variables (concentrations of sodium acetate and glucose) were formulated.

SMFC is considered as an alternative renewable and sustainable power source. Though the SMFC is very appealing energy source, it presents certain challenges for real applications. Its output voltage and current are very low and its output voltage cant be increased by stacking several SMFCs in series in an open water body such as the lake. In this research, we construct and simulate a field SMFC with sediment from Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, China. Open-circuit voltage of the SMFC is 750 mV and the maximal power density is 7.8 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. A custom-designed power management system (PMS) is developed to harvest energy from SMFC and boost the output power that can drive a wireless sensor. With the PMS, wireless sensor can utilize the harvested energy from SMFC and transmit data to computer without additional power source.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.773.74	\N	\N	2013-08-31 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.773.74	["sediment"]	\N	["Cu"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:16.363	2025-07-08 23:49:26.39	\N	\N

The current durability strategy for vehicular fuel cells is geared towards passenger vehicles, hence this study employs response surface analysis to develop a durability strategy for heavy-duty fuel cell trucks. The study uses a physics-based model to predict the degradation of PEMFC under truck operation mode. The model is validated using experimental data from a 20-cell PEMFC stack, which is operated for 2000 hours under the world harmonized vehicle cycle (WHVC) mode. The study employs a response surface method (RSM) to select the power output and degradation rate as object functions. Results indicated that as the operating temperature increases, the power output increases, but the degradation is accelerated. By contrast, increasing gas inlet temperature decreases power output and degradation rate. Higher relative humidity at the cathode and anode leads to increase fuel cell and lower voltage degradation. Therefore, the optimal operating conditions for the fuel cell to minimize voltage degradation are high levels of humidity, moderate cell temperatures, and moderate gas inlet temperatures. The study suggests that the optimal operating conditions are anode and cathode relative humidity of 100%, a fuel cell temperature of 61°C, and a gas inlet temperature of 57°C.</jats:p>	10.1115/imece2023-113108	\N	\N	2023-10-28 22:00:00	Volume 7: Energy	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1115/imece2023-113108	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.328	2025-07-09 00:56:53.328	\N	\N

Charette","Jesse Greener"]	AbstractA common kinetic framework for studies of whole‐cell catalysis is vital for understanding and optimizing bioflow reactors. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of a flow‐adapted version of Michaelis‐Menten kinetics to an electrocatalytic bacterial biofilm. A three‐electrode microfluidic biofilm flow reactor measured increased turnover rates by as much as 50 % from a Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm as flow rate was varied. Based on parameters from the applied kinetic framework, flow‐induced increases to turnover rate, catalytic efficiency and device reaction capacity could be linked to an increase in catalytic biomass. This study demonstrates that a standardized kinetic framework is critical for quantitative measurements of new living catalytic systems in flow reactors and for benchmarking against well‐studied catalytic systems such as enzymes.	10.1002/celc.201900732	\N	\N	2019-05-14 22:00:00	ChemElectroChem	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.201900732	["Geobacter","Geobacter sulfurreducens"]	\N	["Pt"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.782	2025-07-08 18:39:58.556	\N	\N

Photovoltaic arrays and wind turbines are modeled as RESs power flow. Hydrogen and air needed for FC stack to generate the power requested by the load are achieved through the Load-Following control loop. This control loop will regulate the fueling flow rate to load level. A real-time optimization strategy for RES/FC HPS based on Extremum Seeking Control will find the Maximum Efficiency Point or best fuel economy point by control of the boost converter. Therefore, two HPS configurations and associated strategies based on Load-Following and optimization loops of the fueling regulators were studied here and compared using the following performance indicators: the FC net power generated on the DC bus, the FC energy efficiency, the fuel consumption efficiency, and the total fuel consumption. An increase in the FC system’s electrical efficiency and fuel economy of up to 2% and 12% respectively has been obtained using the proposed optimization strategies compared with a baseline strategy.</jats:p>	10.3390/math8020151	\N	\N	2020-01-20 23:00:00	Mathematics	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/math8020151	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:31.88	2025-07-09 00:33:31.88	\N	\N

Khudokormov"]	The high anthropogenic load on the environment makes it necessary to develop new ways of cleaning the environment. One of the promising methods in remediation processes is the use of living organisms. So, for almost every pollutant, it is possible to select the appropriate strain of microorganisms capable of decomposing certain pollutants. The study used benthic-type microbial fuel cells as promising bioengineering systems that can be applied in various areas of human life - medicine, cleaning and environmental monitoring, in the Internet of Things, etc. In addition, the electrogenic potential created by MFC will facilitate the migration of heavy metals towards the anode, which will simplify the process of their removal from the environment or inclusion in the food chains of anodophilic microbiota. As a result of the study, it was found that the most effective in the design of the MFC are horizontal electrodes.

Three types of clays containing different amounts of iron situated in the octahedral sites have been used to modify the ITO electrodes: nontronite NAu-1, montmorillonite (Wyoming) SWy-1, and synthetic montmorillonite SYn-1. The interaction between bacterial cells and the clay, which modified the ITO electrodes were studied by potential step, cyclic voltammetry, confocal microscope, and scanning electron microscope SEM. Experimental results showed that the current density generated using iron containing clays NAu-1 and SWy-1 to modify the ITO electrode was 19 and 3 times higher than that produced using the bare ITO electrode.

H2O2 can be produced by the cathodic reduction of oxygen. We investigated four types of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for this purpose. A GDE made of carbon nanoparticles bound with 30% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (wt./wt.C) to a carbon fiber paper performed best and catalyzed H2O2 production from oxygen in air with a coulombic efficiency of 95.1%. We coupled the GDE to biological anodes in two bioelectrochemical reactors. When the anodes were fed with synthetic wastewater containing acetate they generated a current of up to ∼0.4 mA/mL total anode compartment volume. H2O2 concentrations of ∼0.2 and ∼0.5% could be produced in 5 mL catholyte in 9 and 21 h, respectively. When the anodes were fed with real wastewater, the generated current was ∼0.1 mA/mL and only 84 mg/L of H2O2 was produced.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2012.255	\N	\N	2012-07-31 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND wastewater"]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2012.255	\N	["carbon fiber"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	95.1	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:21.819	2025-07-08 23:49:26.277	\N	\N

Electrode materials play a critical role in the generation of bioelectricity in MFCs. Utilizing double oxidant-treated carbon felts in MFC applications increased current density to 749.56 mA/m2 and increased peak power density to 125.23 mW/m2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis further verified the improved electrocatalytic activity observed in the oxidized carbon felt, consistent with the findings from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and polarization curves, thereby confirming the enhanced performance of the oxidized carbon felt electrode. Overall, the study highlights the significance of electrode morphology and surface modifications in influencing microbial adhesion, electron transport, and the overall efficiency of fuel cells using distillery spent wash as a substrate.</jats:p>	10.3390/electrochem6020012	\N	\N	2025-03-29 23:00:00	Electrochem	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/electrochem6020012	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:31.934	2025-07-09 00:33:31.934	\N	\N

cmcu98odm018zjyup9m80ca7p	Network-Based Methods for Identifying Key Active Proteins in the Extracellular Electron Transfer Process in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1	["Dewu Ding","Xiao Sun"]	Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can transfer electrons from the intracellular environment to the extracellular space of the cells to reduce the extracellular insoluble electron acceptors (Extracellular Electron Transfer, EET). Benefiting from this EET capability, Shewanella has been widely used in different areas, such as energy production, wastewater treatment, and bioremediation. Genome-wide proteomics data was used to determine the active proteins involved in activating the EET process. We identified 1012 proteins with decreased expression and 811 proteins with increased expression when the EET process changed from inactivation to activation. We then networked these proteins to construct the active protein networks, and identified the top 20 key active proteins by network centralization analysis, including metabolism- and energy-related proteins, signal and transcriptional regulatory proteins, translation-related proteins, and the EET-related proteins. We also constructed the integrated protein interaction and transcriptional regulatory networks for the active proteins, then found three exclusive active network motifs involved in activating the EET process—Bi-feedforward Loop, Regulatory Cascade with a Feedback, and Feedback with a Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI)—and identified the active proteins involved in these motifs. Both enrichment analysis and comparative analysis to the whole-genome data implicated the multiheme c-type cytochromes and multiple signal processing proteins involved in the process. Furthermore, the interactions of these motif-guided active proteins and the involved functional modules were discussed. Collectively, by using network-based methods, this work reported a proteome-wide search for the key active proteins that potentially activate the EET process.	10.3390/genes9010041	\N	\N	\N	Genes	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/genes9010041	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Fe"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.811	2025-07-08 18:39:40.892	\N	\N

Currently, a form of natural decomposition, known as composting technology, is widely used to deal with organic waste. This method is applied to enhance the performance of solid microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) in this study. Operational composting parameters (carbon/nitrogen ratio, moisture content and pH value) are investigated to explore the optimal power performance of solid microbial fuel cells (SMFCs). Results indicate that the carbon/nitrogen ratio and the moisture content displayed the most significant impact on SMFCs. When the carbon/nitrogen ratio is 31.4 and moisture content is 60%, along with a pH value of 6–8, a better SMFC power performance would be obtained. These findings would provide positive information regarding the application of compost in SMFCs.</jats:p>	10.3390/su70912634	\N	\N	2015-09-14 22:00:00	Sustainability	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/su70912634	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:32.041	2025-07-09 00:33:32.041	\N	\N

BES takes advantage of microbial interaction with a solid electron acceptor/donor to accomplish bioenergy recovery from organic compounds, and FO can extract high-quality water driven by an osmotic pressure. The strong synergy between those two technologies may complement each other and collaboratively address water-energy nexus. FO can assist BES with achieving water recovery (for future reuse), enhancing electricity generation, and supplying energy for accomplishing the cathode reactions; while BES may help FO with degrading organic contaminants, providing sustainable draw solute, and stabilizing water flux. This work has reviewed the recent development that focuses on the synergy between BES and FO, analyzed the advantages of each combination, and provided perspectives for future research. The findings encourage further investigation and development for efficient coordination between BES and FO towards an integrated system for wastewater treatment and reuse.</jats:p>	10.3390/w7010038	\N	\N	2014-12-22 23:00:00	Water	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND wastewater"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/w7010038	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:22.074	2025-07-08 18:40:08.944	\N	\N

MET-based anaerobic digestion (AD) systems treating swine manure were operated at different applied voltages (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 V) and temperatures (25, 35, and 45 °C). Among the MET-based AD systems with different applied voltages at 35 °C, M4 at 0.7 V showed the highest methane production (2.96 m3-CH4/m3) and methane yield (0.64 m3-CH4/kg-VS). The methane production and yield increased with increasing temperature at an applied voltage of 0.7 V. Nevertheless, the MET-based AD systems (LM at 25 °C and 0.7V) showed competitive AD performance (2.33 m3-CH4/m3 and 0.53 m3-CH4/VS) compared with the conventional AD system (35 °C). The microbial community was affected by the applied voltage and temperature, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as M. flavescens, M. hungatei, and M. thermautotrophicus were mainly responsible for methane production in MET-based AD systems. Therefore, the methane production can be enhanced by an applied voltage or by direct interspecies electron transfer because M. flavescens and M. thermautotrophicus were especially predominant in cathode of MET-based AD systems. The MET-based AD systems can help enhance biogas production from swine manure with no significant change in methane content. Furthermore, MET-based AD systems will be a promising AD system through low material development and the optimal operation.</jats:p>	10.1007/s10295-019-02182-6	\N	\N	2019-06-30 22:00:00	Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial electrochemical\\" AND performance"]	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10295-019-02182-6	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:22.461	2025-07-08 23:43:02.628	\N	\N

Loaiza","William Lizcano-Valbuena"]	<jats:p>A dual-chambered microbial fuel cell with aqueous cathode was operated with domestic wastewater to investigate the electrogenic ability of anaerobic bacteria from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Curves of cell potential vs. current density, power density vs. current density and current at a fixed load of 100 Ω, were obtained daily to monitor the electrochemical evolution of the system as a function of substrate use in several batch cycles. A maximum power density of 1.11 µWcm-2 was obtained after 65 days of continuous operation and a coulombic efficiency of 7% and a chemical oxygen demand removal of 76% were found in the last batch cycle. Anaerobic culture of the bacteria from the anode biofilm resulted in the isolation of two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria with divergent sugar fermentation capabilities, while analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments showed three clones from the phyla Firmicutes, δ-Proteobacteria and α-Proteobacteria. Scanning electron imaging analysis revealed an increase in cell diversity and proliferation of methanogenic archaea when changing from synthetic to real wastewater. These results reveal the influence of substrate concentration and presence of methanogenic microorganisms on the production of power in microbial fuel cells, suggesting that future developments could be a contribution for the use of this technology to decontaminate domestic wastewater in small communities.</jats:p>	10.25100/rc.v22i2.7910	\N	\N	2019-05-07 22:00:00	Revista de Ciencias	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial electrochemical\\" AND performance"]	https://doi.org/10.25100/rc.v22i2.7910	["anaerobic sludge"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	7	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:21.685	2025-07-08 23:43:02.732	\N	\N
cmcv910hn001914few531rd8d	Fuel Cell Distributed Generation System for Cooling	["A. I. ElSherbini","A. M. Al-Qattan"]	<jats:p>Air conditioning (A/C) systems are the major consumers of power in hot climates. In a country like Kuwait, A/C accounts for 85% of power supplied to homes during peak hours and 55% of annual energy consumption by the residential sector. A fuel-cell-based cogeneration system is proposed to improve the efficiency of generating and utilizing power for cooling in residential buildings. Distributed electric power is generated by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The electricity is used to operate high-efficiency water-cooled chillers in a district-cooling setup, which replaces packaged A/C units typically used for homes. The exhaust fuel and heat from the SOFC operate a gas turbine and an absorption chiller. A thermal energy storage tank is used for storing chilled water to reduce the total capacity of the system and, hence, capital investment. The integrated fuel-cell air-conditioning (FCAC) system improves the cooling-to-fuel efficiency, expressed as coefficient of performance, by 375%. The peak power requirement is reduced by 65% and the total fuel energy is reduced by 58%. An example system of 2 MW delivers 3750 RT (13.2 MW) of cooling to a district. Over a 9-month period, it saves 94 TJ of fuel energy and feeds 5.21 GWh of electricity to the grid as a surplus.</jats:p>	10.1115/fuelcell2008-65190	\N	\N	2007-12-31 23:00:00	ASME 2008 6th International Conference on Fuel Cell Science, Engineering and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1115/fuelcell2008-65190	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.435	2025-07-09 00:56:53.435	\N	\N

cmcv910j4001b14feoiqyxbza	Determination of Electrogenic Potential and Removal of Organic Matter from Industrial Coffee Wastewater Using a Native Community in a Non-Conventional Microbial Fuel Cell	["Santiago Erazo","Lina María Agudelo-Escobar"]	<jats:p>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are an alternative to conventional wastewater treatments that allow for the removal of organic matter and cogeneration of electrical energy, taking advantage of the oxidation–reduction metabolism of organic compounds conducted by microorganisms. In this study, the electrogenic potential and the capacity for the reduction of the organic matter of native microbial communities in wastewater from the wet processing of coffee were evaluated using open-cathode MFCs. To determine the electrogenic potential, a factorial experimental design was proposed in which the origin of the residual water and the source of the inoculum were evaluated as factors. The MFCs operated for 21 days in both open-circuit and closed-circuit operation modes. Voltage records, current determinations, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analyses were used to establish the power reached in the electrochemical system and the degree of the decontamination of the wastewater. During the MFC operation, voltages from 200–400 mV and power and current densities from 300–900 mW·m−2 and 10–22 mA·m−2, respectively, were reached. The inoculum used, with a statistical significance of α &lt; 0.05, influenced the electrogenic performance of the microbial fuel cell. The previous process of adaptation to the operational conditions of the MFCs of the native microbial community positively influenced the current generation in the system. The degradation rates reached 500–600 mg·L−1·day−1, indicating the metabolic capacity of the microbial community in the MFCs to achieve the decontamination of wastewater from the coffee agroindustry. It was shown the implementation of bioelectrochemical systems constituted a viable option for the treatment of agricultural waste in Colombia. In addition, it was observed the capacity to cogenerate electrical energy from the biotransformation of the polluting organic matter in the effluents of the coffee industry.</jats:p>	10.3390/pr11020373	\N	\N	2023-01-24 23:00:00	Processes	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11020373	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.489	2025-07-09 00:56:53.489	\N	\N

cmcv910kn001d14fer8wwpkqw	Evaluation of the electricity generation potential of bacteria with microbial fuel cell technology using abattoir effluent as a substrate	["Ayisa Timothy Terna","Muhammad Ramatu Gogo","Mohammed Jibrin Ndejiko"]	<jats:p>The concerns about global warming are gradually causing sensitive debate globally therefore its pertinent at this period to intensify the quest for alternative sources of energy. The potential of abattoir effluent to generate electricity at room temperature via microbial fuel cell technology  has been demonstrated. Microbial fuel cell is a bio electrochemical system which utilizes bacteria to generate electricity. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of bacteria to generate electricity through microbial fuel cells with abattoir effluent serving as a substrate. The study was carried out using a dual chambered microbial fuel cell. And the set up was monitored for a period of seven days. Readings were taken at intervals of two hours all through the experiment. The highest voltage generated was 0.58V on the first day and the lowest voltage recorded was 0.05V on the seventh day. The results from this study indicate that bacteria in microbial fuel cells can utilize abattoir effluent converting chemical energy to electrical energy. The low voltage generated makes microbial fuel cells less efficient than traditional energy generation methods. There is still much to be learned about complex interactions between micro organisms and electrode materials in microbial fuel cells. Hence, further research is needed to develop more efficient, durable and cost effective materials for microbial fuel cells.</jats:p>	10.4314/jobasr.v3i3.9	\N	\N	2025-06-10 22:00:00	Journal of Basics and Applied Sciences Research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4314/jobasr.v3i3.9	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:53.543	2025-07-09 00:56:53.543	\N	\N

When fed by synthetic wastewater, with a 400mg/l COD concentration the maximum power density of the MFC was 71.5mW/m2 (at 0.8 A/m2). With a NaCl concentration of 0.1M put into the influent, it increased from 42.0 mW/m2 (at 0.25 A/m2) to 141.7mW/m2 (at 1.1A/m2), and the internal resistance also decreased significantly from 300Ω to 77Ω. The optimal operation temperature was 30oC, with a power density of 140.7mW/m2 (at 1.0 A/m2). When fed by starch processing wastewater, the average power density of the MFC was 100mW/m2, while fed by the effluent from an anaerobic reactor treating the starch wastewater; it was 90mW/m2. Different substrates resulted in significant influence on microbial community on the anode of the MFC, while the anode connected into the circuit or not did not cause obvious difference in the microbial community structure.	10.1149/1.3036208	\N	\N	2008-11-17 00:00:00	ECS Transactions	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/1.3036208	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	71500	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:21.315	2025-07-08 18:40:27.767	\N	\N

cmcumjg750022ae3whzd6c010	Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose coupled with electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell	["Farzaneh Rezaei","Tom L. Richard","Bruce E. Logan"]	AbstractElectricity can be directly generated by bacteria in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) from a variety of biodegradable substrates, including cellulose. Particulate materials have not been extensively examined for power generation in MFCs, but in general power densities are lower than those produced with soluble substrates under similar conditions likely as a result of slow hydrolysis rates of the particles. Cellulases are used to achieve rapid conversion of cellulose to sugar for ethanol production, but these enzymes have not been previously tested for their effectiveness in MFCs. It was not known if cellulases would remain active in an MFC in the presence of exoelectrogenic bacteria or if enzymes might hinder power production by adversely affecting the bacteria. Electricity generation from cellulose was therefore examined in two‐chamber MFCs in the presence and absence of cellulases. The maximum power density with enzymes and cellulose was 100 ± 7 mW/m2 (0.6 ± 0.04 W/m3), compared to only 12 ± 0.6 mW/m2 (0.06 ± 0.003 W/m3) in the absence of the enzymes. This power density was comparable to that achieved in the same system using glucose (102 ± 7 mW/m2, 0.56 ± 0.038 W/m3) suggesting that the enzyme successfully hydrolyzed cellulose and did not otherwise inhibit electricity production by the bacteria. The addition of the enzyme doubled the Coulombic efficiency (CE) to CE = 51% and increased COD removal to 73%, likely as a result of rapid hydrolysis of cellulose in the reactor and biodegradation of the enzyme. These results demonstrate that cellulases do not adversely affect exoelectrogenic bacteria that produce power in an MFC, and that the use of these enzymes can increase power densities and reactor performance.

cmcumjlb1002wae3wad29i0m9	Review of Microbial Fuel Cells for Wastewater Treatment: Large-Scale Applications, Future Needs and Current Research Gaps	["Michael G. Waller","Thomas A. Trabold"]	There is growing interest in innovative waste water treatment technologies that can utilize the inherent energy-producing potential of organic waste. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a type of bioreactor that produces electricity by converting energy in the chemical bonds of organic material, through a catalytic reaction of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. MFCs provide a promising low cost, highly efficient, and renewable energy-producing alternative to conventional wastewater treatments. MFC technology at the laboratory scale has advanced to the point where chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies (RE) over 90% are commonly achieved; however, low coulombic efficiencies (CE) and power densities often result when treating actual industrial and domestic wastewaters. In spite of their low energy recovery and power production, MFCs have been shown to be economically viable when factoring in costs savings from the sale of produced chemical byproducts and reduction of solid waste removal costs. However, further research of large-scale MFC wastewater treatment applications must be performed to determine the extent of their feasibility. This paper reviews several pilot-test MFC systems, addresses promising future industrial applications, and discusses current research gaps in MFC technology for wastewater treatment. Of particular interest in our research program is the use of MFCs to treat liquid-phase organic waste generated at food processing plants. Because of the general scalability of fuel cell systems, there is reason to believe that an MFC treatment system would be better suited to relatively small waste flow rates, unlike other treatment methods (e.g., anaerobic digestion) which typically require large volume to achieve economic viability.	10.1115/fuelcell2013-18185	\N	\N	2013-07-13 22:00:00	ASME 2013 11th International Conference on Fuel Cell Science, Engineering and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1115/fuelcell2013-18185	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:29.053	2025-07-08 18:40:13.757	\N	\N

Characteristics of PEMFC depend highly on the\nconditions such as gas pressure, temperature, thickness, supplied oxidant type (Oxygen/Air) as well\nas humidification. They are controlled under the same condition for the comparison of the simulation.\nTesting condition is fixed at 60sccm and 70°C in anode and cathode, respectively. The humidification\nabout 15% the performance is improved no humidification rather. The current density is increased\naround 20% significantly when pure oxygen gas is provided as an oxidant. It is found that measured\nvalues of unit cell voltage and current are influenced strongly by the type and amount of oxidant,\nwhich give more enhanced values in case of oxygen compared to the ambient air as oxidant.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/msf.544-545.993	\N	\N	2007-05-14 22:00:00	Materials Science Forum	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/msf.544-545.993	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:58:14.006	2025-07-09 00:58:14.006	\N	\N

Tsau"]	<jats:p>A 3kW PEMFC power generation system is developed by Energy and Resources Laboratories in 2002. This system integrates hydrogen storage, fuel reformer, power conversion, hot water tank as well as a 3kW PEMFC stack. The power generation efficiency at 30% and total energy efficiency with hot water recovery at 67% are designed. The stack is key component of this system, and its performance is tested and analyzed before it is integrated into the system. This paper presents its performance in I-V polarization curves with controlling parameters such as fuel cell operating temperature, air humidity, hydrogen humidity and stoichimetric ratio of air. Detailed discussions are given for the effect of each parameter on stack’s performance.</jats:p>	10.1115/fuelcell2004-2471	\N	\N	2003-12-31 23:00:00	2nd International Conference on Fuel Cell Science, Engineering and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1115/fuelcell2004-2471	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 01:05:47.772	2025-07-09 01:05:47.772	\N	\N

cmcu7vyqm000s1145rnqq6mdq	Progress in Nitrogen Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems	["Jin Sun","Hongrui Cao","Zejie Wang"]	Nitrogenous compounds attract great attention because of their environmental impact and harmfulness to the health of human beings. Various biological technologies have been developed to reduce the environmental risks of nitrogenous pollutants. Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are considered to be a novel biological technology for removing nitrogenous contaminants by virtue of their advantages, such as low energy requirement and capacity for treating wastewaters with a low C/N ratio. Therefore, increasing attention has been given to carry out biological processes related to nitrogen removal with the aid of cathodic biofilms in BESs. Prior studies have evaluated the feasibility of conventional biological processes including nitrification, denitrification, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), separately or combined together, to remove nitrogenous compounds with the help of BESs. The present review summarizes the progress of developments in BESs in terms of the biological process, cathodic biofilm, and affecting factors for efficient nitrogen removal.	10.3390/pr8070831	\N	\N	2020-07-12 22:00:00	Processes	\N	\N	\N	["bioelectrochemical"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/pr8070831	["wastewater"]	\N	["iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:12.095	2025-07-08 18:39:55.203	\N	\N

Due to its carcinogenicity, Cr(VI) has to be removed, using environmental-friendly and economically sustainable remediation technologies. BioElectrochemical Systems (BESs), applied to bioremediation, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional bioremediation techniques, without affecting the natural groundwater conditions. Some bacterial families are capable of oxidizing and/or reducing a solid electrode obtaining an energetic advantage for their own growth. In the present study, we assessed the possibility of stimulating bioelectrochemical reduction of Cr(VI) in a dual-chamber polarized system using an electrode as the sole energy source. To develop an electroactive microbial community three electrodes were, at first, inserted into the anodic compartment of a dual-chamber microbial fuel cell, and inoculated with sludge from an anaerobic digester. After a period of acclimation, one electrode was transferred into a polarized system and it was fixed at −0.3 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode, SHE), to promote the reduction of 1000 µg Cr(VI) L−1. A second electrode, served for the set-up of an open circuit control, operated in parallel. Cr(VI) dissolved concentration was analysed at the initial, during the experiment and final time by spectrophotometric method. Initial and final microbial characterization of the communities enriched in polarized system and open circuit control was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The bioelectrode set at −0.3 V showed high Cr(VI) removal efficiency (up to 93%) and about 150 µg L−1 day−1 removal rate. Similar efficiency was observed in the open circuit (OC) even at about half rate. Whereas, purely electrochemical reduction, limited to 35%, due to neutral operating conditions. These results suggest that bioelectrochemical Cr(VI) removal by polarized electrode offers a promising new and sustainable approach to the treatment of groundwater Cr(VI) plumes, deserving further research.	10.3390/w12020466	\N	\N	2020-02-09 23:00:00	Water	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020466	\N	\N	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	1	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:11.087	2025-07-08 18:39:56.091	\N	\N
cmcu7w0ak000u1145dmjshncg	(Keynote) Revisiting Protection Matrices for Bioelectrochemical Systems	["Nicolas Plumeré"]	Redox hydrogel films are among the most practical approaches for protecting O2-sensitive biocatalysts such as hydrogenases from O2 inactivation in bioelectrochemical devices (1). Their protection mechanism relies on the viologen catalyzed reduction of O2 with electrons diverted from the hydrogenase catalyzed H2 oxidation. Despite multiple example of the versatility and universal applicability of the concept (1-3), numerous key question related to their practical use remain open. The lecture will cover unresolved points related to (i) the generation of reactive oxygen species, (ii) the use of excessive thicknesses to ensure protection as well as (iii) the elusive direct evidence for the protection mechanism. Recent progress in the ability to form films with controlled thicknesses (4) and the use of confocal fluorescence microscopy led to new exciting insights in these systems. (1) N. Plumeré, O.

Electron consumption occurred at set potentials of −439 mV and −539 mV (versus the potential of a standard hydrogen electrode) but not at −339 mV in minimal media lacking organic sources of energy. Results at these different potentials were consistent with separate linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans that indicated enhanced activity (current consumption) below only ca. −400 mV. MFC bioanodes not originally acclimated at a set potential produced electron-accepting (electrotrophic) biocathodes, but bioanodes operated at a set potential (+11 mV) did not. CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            was removed from cathode headspace, indicating that the electrotrophic biocathodes were autotrophic.

There was abundant microbial growth in the biocathode chamber, as evidenced by an increase in turbidity and the presence of microorganisms on the cathode surface.

Fish feed and manure are the primary sources of ammonia in catfish farming ponds. High concentrations of ammonia can cause death. Therefore, it is necessary to control the presence of ammonia to minimize the potential for fish mortality. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a technology that can help with ammonia bioremediation. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) in reducing ammonia. The research method used is an experimental research method with qualitative descriptive analysis. The research was conducted on a laboratory scale using a dual-chamber Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) reactor connected using a salt bridge.

The electrode is the key point for ABD system, which was sparsely studied with food waste. In this study, a carbon-modified copper foam was fabricated with copper foam and multiple wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) through electrophoretic deposition and screen-printing methods. The carbon-modified copper foam electrode was investigated in an ABD reactor for food waste. The features of bioelectrochemical methane production, process stability, and electrochemical characterization were evaluated in the ABD reactor, and were compared to the control reactor without equipping electrode. The ultimate methane production reached 338.1 mL CH4/L in the ABD reactor, which was significantly higher than the 181.0 mL CH4/L of the control reactor. The methane produced from the electrode was 137.8 mL CH4/L, which was up to 40.8% of total methane production in the ABD reactor. It was attributed to the electroactive bacteria that were enriched and activated by the carbon-modified copper foam electrode, further activating the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathways for methane production. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis showed higher redox peaks, which is one of the pieces of evidence for the enrichment of electroactive bacteria. The carbon-modified copper foam electrode has the advantages of both carbon and metal materials, and demonstrated a high possibility for use in bioelectrochemical methane production for food waste.</jats:p>	10.3390/pr8040416	\N	\N	2020-03-31 22:00:00	Processes	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND \\"carbon nanotube\\""]	https://doi.org/10.3390/pr8040416	\N	["carbon nanotube","CNT","MWCNT"]	["carbon","copper","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:59.427	2025-07-08 23:49:25.09	\N	\N

This is due to the underlying current density being operated increasingly close to the maximum current-carrying capacity (ampacity) of the materials (copper, gold...) used in the conduction channels of micro-circuitry. In this respect, there is a growing attention for new materials with higher ampacity, and copper-carbon nanotube (CNT) composites could constitute a promising alternative.

Zhu"]	AbstractIn the technology of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for simultaneous electricity production and wastewater purification, the electricity production of MFCs decreases when the salt concentration in the wastewater is high. Increasing the electricity production of MFCs under high salt conditions is a great challenge. This paper studies the reasons for the decline of electricity production of MFCs under high salt conditions and develops ways to increase the electricity generation. The results show that high salt inhibits the growth of electrogenic microorganisms on the anode of MFCs, thereby reducing the electricity production. Addition of ectoine, an osmotic pressure compensated solute, can increase the salt tolerance of electrogenic microorganisms, thereby increasing the electricity generation of MFCs. With the addition of 1 mmol L−1 ectoine to the substrate, the average voltage output of the MFCs based on mixed microbial flora anode was increased by 60.4% (±3.9%). Under this condition, microbial diversity analysis showed that the dominant growth and electricity production genus Acinetobacter accounted for 38.9% in the microbial community of anode biofilm.	10.1002/fuce.201900051	\N	\N	2019-10-01 00:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201900051	\N	\N	["Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.446	2025-07-08 18:39:57.48	\N	\N

In this work, microalgae (Chlorella sp. QB-102) were used as a biocatalyst in the cathode, and foam nickel modified by graphene oxide with two degrees of oxidation was used as the electrode. The results showed that the maximum power density of PMMFCs with high oxidation degree graphene oxide modified electrode (NF-GO-H) reached 209.07 mW·m-2, which was 6 times that of PMMFCs with low oxidation degree graphene oxide modified electrode (NF-GO-L), indicating that the use of the NF-GO-H electrode can effectively improve the electrical properties of PMMFCs. Simultaneously, the NF-GO-H electrode can effectively remove Cd(II), with a capacity of 6.039 g·m-2, which is twice that of the NF-GO-L electrode. Moreover, through the synergistic electrochemical action of Chlorella sp. QB-102, a large number of hydroxyl groups can be generated to convert the adsorbed Cd(II) into a more stable Cd(OH)2 precipitate. The results of this work will further expand the application of PMMFCs in power generation and heavy metal removal.	10.20517/mmm.2022.11	\N	\N	\N	Minerals and Mineral Materials	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.20517/mmm.2022.11	\N	["graphene","graphene oxide","GO","nickel"]	["Fe","nickel","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.505	2025-07-08 18:39:37.871	\N	\N

The adverse effects are noticeable as crystallization in equipment and pipelines due to high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, improved technologies are required that can treat urine separately at the source of their origin and then discharge it in the main wastewater stream. In this study, the performance of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) was evaluated with mixed consortia and isolated pure cultures (Firmicutes and Proteobacter species) from biofilm for electricity generation and nutrient recovery. Microbes utilize less than 10% of total phosphorus for their growth, while 90% is recovered as struvite. The amount of struvite recovered was similar for pure and mixed culture (12 ± 5 g/L). The microbial characterization also shows that not all the biofilm-forming bacterial isolates are very much efficient in power generation and, hence, they can be further exploited to study their individual role in operating MFC. The different organic loading rates experiment shows that the performance of MFC in terms of power generation is the same for undiluted and five times diluted urine while the recovery of nutrients is better with undiluted urine, implying its direct use of urine in operating fuel cell.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2019.089	\N	\N	2019-02-14 23:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND graphene"]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2019.089	["mixed culture"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:49.6	2025-07-08 23:49:25.427	\N	\N

Simulated potato-processing wastewater was used as a substrate for supporting the growth of a mixed bacterial culture. The maximum power output increased from 0.386 mW with one MFC to 1.047 mW with three MFCs connected in series. The maximum power density, however, decreased from 576 mW/m2 (normalized to the cathode area) with one MFC to 520 mW/m2 with three MFCs in series. The experimental results showed that power can be increased by connecting the MFCs in series; however, choosing low resistance BC is crucial for increasing power density.</jats:p>	10.3390/pr9122194	\N	\N	2021-12-05 23:00:00	Processes	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/pr9122194	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:36.522	2025-07-09 00:33:36.522	\N	\N

Ng"]	<jats:p>The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an innovative technology for producing electricity directly from biodegradable organic matter using bacteria. Among all the influenceable factors, anode materials play a crucial role in electricity generation. Recently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have exhibited promising properties as electrode material due to their unique structural, and physical and chemical properties. In this study, the impacts of CNT types in CNT-based anodes were investigated to determine their effect on both efficiency of wastewater treatment and power generation. The CNTs, namely single-walled CNT with carboxyl group (SWCNT), multi-walled CNT with carboxyl group (MWCNT-COOH) and multi-walled CNT with hydroxyl group (MWCNT-OH) were used to fabricate CNT-based anodes by a filtration method. Overall, MWCNTs provided better results than SWCNTs, especially in the presence of the -OH groups. The highest power and treatment efficiencies in MFC were achieved with an anode made of MWCNT-OH filtered on Poreflon membrane; the open circuit voltage attained was 0.75 V and the maximum power density averaged 167 mW/m2, which was 130% higher than that obtained with plain carbon cloth. In addition, MWCNT-OH is more cost-effective, further suggesting its potential to replace plain carbon cloth generally used for the MFC anode.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2014.102	\N	\N	2014-02-25 23:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2014.102	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:36.577	2025-07-09 00:33:36.577	\N	\N

Talawar","Qingping Du","Gangyi Li"]	The electricity output from microbial fuel cell (MFC) with a microalgae assisted cathode is usually higher than that with an air cathode. The output of electricity from a photosynthetic microalgae MFC was positively correlated with the dissolved oxygen (DO) level in the microalgae assisted biocathode. However, DO is highly affected by the photosynthesis of microalgae, leading to the low stability in the electricity output that easily varies with the change in microalgae growth. In this study, to improve the electricity output stability of the MFC, a partially submerged carbon cloth cathode electrode was first investigated to use oxygen from both microalgae and air, with synthetic piggery wastewater used as the anolyte and anaerobically digested swine wastewater as the catholyte. When the DO levels dropped from 13.6–14.8 to 1.0–1.6 mg/L, the working voltages in the MFCs with partially submerged electrodes remained high (256–239 mV), whereas that for the conventional completely submerged electrodes dropped from 259 to 102 mV. The working voltages (average, 297 ± 26 mV) of the MFCs with the 50% submerged electrodes were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than with other partially or completely submerged electrodes. The associated maximum lipid production from wastewater was 250 ± 42 mg/L with lipid content of 41 ± 6% dry biomass. Although the partially submerged electrode had no significant effects on lipid production or nitrogen removal in wastewater, there was significant improvement in the stability of the electricity generated under variable conditions.	10.3390/en12173229	\N	\N	\N	Energies	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/en12173229	\N	["carbon cloth"]	["carbon","air cathode","Fe","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.552	2025-07-08 18:39:37.778	\N	\N

These materials are crucial in improving the performance of supercapacitors, particularly in terms of specific capacitance. Fe oxide‐based composites are attractive negative electrode materials for cutting‐edge supercapacitor technologies because of their high specific capacitance, broad potential window, outstanding cycle stability and adaptability in asymmetric design. The synthesized Fe─Ni oxide/reduced graphene oxide (FNG) composite delivered ≈500 F g−1 specific capacitance at ≈2 A g−1 current density. The work also describes the hydrothermal synthesis of a bimetallic oxide like zinc oxide‐manganese oxide (ZMO) as a positive material to fabricate asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The electrochemical results achieved from the three‐electrode configuration of ZMO indicate true pseudocapacitive behavior with the triangular charge–discharge curve. The fabricated ASC with ZMO as cathode and FNG as anode delivered energy, and power densities are ≈32 W h kg−1 and ≈2.3 kW kg−1, respectively.	10.1002/adsu.202400329	\N	\N	2025-03-31 22:00:00	Advanced Sustainable Systems	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202400329	\N	["graphene","graphene oxide","reduced graphene oxide"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.591	2025-07-08 18:39:42.076	\N	\N

Narvaez Villarubia","Sarah Stariha","Sofia Babanova","Matteo Grattieri","Alexey Serov","Plamen Atanassov"]	<jats:p>Due to the high cost of wastewater treatement, new and alternative low cost technologies need to be investigated. Bioelectrochemical systems and particularly microbial fuel cells (MFCs) seem to address positively this problem. In MFCs the organic waste is utilized as a fuel that is oxidised from microorganisms through their metabolism generating electricity. The main problem related with MFCs utilization is the small electricity production and high cost of the electrodes materials. These are the major reasons why MFCs are not commercialized in a large scale yet.  In order to overcome the high cost, that is mainly related to the high price of the noble metals used as catalysts at the cathode, inexpensive catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) should be explored. These catalysts belong to the group of non platinum based catalyst that are proved as very active towards ORR. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work focused on the utilization of a low cost non-PGM (Fe-Aminoantipyrine) catalyst explored in the design of oxygen reducing cathode for MFCs application. The activity of this catalyst was characterized electrochemically in a three-electrode configuration varying the pH of the electroyte. Then the cathodes were introduced in double chamber MFC (Figure 1) with the cathode completely immersed in the solution. The two compartments (125 ml) of the MFC were separated by proton-exchange membrane (Nafion 211). The anode composed of carbon brush (6x4 cm projected surface area) pre-colonized with mixed cultured bacteria. The anode chamber was filled with 50% in volume PBS (50 mM) and 50% in volume of activated sludge (pH=7.5±0.1).  The non-PGM cathode (2.3 x 2.3 cm geometric area) was immersed in solution with different pHs (6, 7.5, 9 and 11) and purged with air for oxygen supply. The MFCs performance was investigated at different pHs in order to simulate possible industrial wastes with pHs different than neutral.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The catalyst used in this work was synthesized by modified sacrificial support method which was developed at UNM<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>.

Power curves were determined using Ohm`s law (P= V x I).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The electrochemical measurements of the cathode as a result of differences in the electrolyte pH showed highest electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst at lower pHs.

Three types of MFC process configurations include the batch mode (SS), a continuous flow of influent with ferricyanide (PF) as the oxidizing agent and a continuous flow of influent with oxygen (PU) as the oxidizing agent. The highest quantity of electricity generation was achieved using the continuous flow mode with ferricyanide (0.833 V), followed by the continuous flow mode with oxygen (0.589 V) and the batch mode (0.352 V). The highest efficiency of carbon removal is also achieved by the continuous flow mode with ferricyanide (87%), followed by the continuous flow mode with oxygen (51%) and the batch mode (46%). Moreover, the continuous flow mode with ferricyanide produced the highest efficiency for nitrogen removal (63%), followed by the continuous flow mode with oxygen (54%) and the batch mode (27%).</jats:p>	10.11113/jt.v74.4544	\N	\N	2015-05-13 22:00:00	Jurnal Teknologi	\N	\N	\N	["MFC AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.11113/jt.v74.4544	\N	\N	["carbon","Fe","Ni","ferricyanide"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:42.419	2025-07-08 23:49:25.662	\N	\N
cmcv86xii00011yhig13abvzj	A 4-Electrode Microfluidic Microbial Fuel Cell Doubles Power Output and Conversion Efficiency, but Gravitational Effects must Be Overcome	["Linlin Liu","Haleh Baghernavehsi","Jesse Greener"]	<jats:p>High-power output and high conversion efficiency are crucial in the study of microfluidic microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In our previous work, we attempted various methods to increase the power density of the MFCs, but nutrient consumption was limited to the bottom (electrode) layer of the microfluidic channel due to the diffusion limitations. In this work, long-term experiments were conducted on a new 4-electrode microfluidic MFC design, which grew Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms on upward- and downward-facing electrodes in the microchannel. It was discovered that inoculation and growth of the electroactive biofilm did not proceed as fast as the downward facing anode, which we hypothesize is due to gravity effects that negatively impacted bacterial settling on that surface. Rotating the device during the growth phase resulted in uniform and strong outputs from both sides, yielding individual power densities of 4.03 and 4.13 W m-2, which was increased to nearly double when the top- and bottom-side electrodes were operated in parallel as a single 4-electrode MFC. Similarly, acetate consumption could be doubled with the 4-electrodes operated in parallel.</jats:p>	10.20944/preprints202407.0531.v1	\N	\N	2024-07-07 22:00:00	\N	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202407.0531.v1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:29.898	2025-07-09 00:33:29.898	\N	\N
cmcu98oa9011bjyupe9ws8rqo	Treatment of Textile Industry Wastewater using Microbial Fuel Cell	[]	Recent research have found out that Bio Electrochemical Systems (BES) are proving to be efficient in both power generation and in waste disposal. The best example for a BES is a microbial fuel cell. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) uses the organic and the inorganic materials in the wastewater to produce electricity by the action of the microbes on them. Thus the MFC’s can be used for both bio-electricity generation and wastewater treatment. The power generation and the efficiency of the MFC depends on various factors like the type of bacteria, type of electrode used and organic content in the effluent. Experiments were carried out to treat textile industry wastewater using Microbial Fuel Cell. Graphite was used as anode, stainless steel and aluminium mesh were used as cathode. Influence of cathodes on power production and COD reduction on process has been critically examined. The maximum power density and COD reduction were observed in graphite and stainless steel electrode system	10.35940/ijrte.d1021.1284s219	\N	\N	\N	International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.35940/ijrte.d1021.1284s219	\N	["graphite","stainless steel"]	["Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.69	2025-07-08 18:39:37.514	\N	\N
cmcu98oa60117jyup97iy3rc3	Generation of Electricity from Abattoir Waste Using Microbial Fuel Cell	["Jeje JO","Oladepo KT","Oyegoke SO"]	This study undertook the generation of electricity from abattoir waste with the aim of eliminating the polluting effects of this waste. To achieve the aim of the study, three abattoirs were randomly selected within Ile-Ife in Osun State, southwest Nigeria. Using interactive and investigative methods, the average number of cows and goats that were slaughtered daily, weekly and monthly was established; and the amount of waste generated was subsequently estimated. Water samples were collected from water sources for the abattoirs. Wastewater samples were also collected at different carefully selected stages of the abattoir processes. The wastewater samples were exposed to air for 6 hours to 48 hours. The water and wastewater samples were then subjected to physico-chemical analysis, using standard procedures. Using standard method and appropriate materials, salt bridge was prepared and Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) were assembled. Subsequently, electrical set up was done, abattoir wastewater introduced into the chamber and electricity generated and evaluated. Voltage, voltage drop, power and current readings were observed and recorded for a period of six (6) days (between 131-144 hours). Surveys revealed that an average of two (2) cows was slaughtered daily in each abattoir. Results showed that the quantity of waste generated from each abattoir per day stands at 100-120 kg per day. For fresh water samples, the pH fell within WHO standard (6.98 to 7.05); while the average pH value for the wastewaters showed that it is basic. Also, for fresh water samples, TS, TSS and BOD values met WHO standard (340 to 440 mg/l), 200 to 220 mg/l and 240 to 600 mg/l) respectively, while the values were excessively high for wastewaters. Generally, the voltage generated from waste with longest exposure to air had the least values. The study concluded that electricity generation is possible from abattoir waste using microbial fuel cells.	10.16966/2381-5299.189	\N	\N	\N	International Journal of Water and Wastewater Treatment	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.16966/2381-5299.189	\N	["GO"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.686	2025-07-08 18:39:37.566	\N	\N

Under the same hydraulic retention time, different volumes of sludge were extracted from the anode compartment, thereby modifying the SA. Such changes affect the electrochemical performance, the organic matter biodegradation and consequently, the coulombic efficiency. A sludge volume of 0.01 L (corresponding to a SA of 24 d) appears to be optimal, because this favors the development of electricity–generating microorganisms (EGM). Shorter SA times wash EGM out of the system and promote growth of the fermenter (mainly acidogenic bacteria), whereas a longer SA reduces the microbial population. A final product analysis identified that short SAs provide favorable conditions in which higher concentrations of short–chain organic acids are detected.</jats:p>	10.1002/fuce.201800089	\N	\N	2018-11-25 23:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201800089	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:54.811	2025-07-09 00:33:54.811	\N	\N

In this work, we present the outcomes derived from EC treatment of pharmaceutical and synthetic textile wastewater effluents in two lab-scale reactors with and without aeration, each equipped with different electrode combinations of aluminium and iron (Al/Al, Al/Fe, and Fe/Fe). In the non-aerated EC reactor, maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) reductions of 56% and 80% were achieved for the pharmaceutical and textile effluents, respectively, with up to 100% removal of turbidity and colour with the Al/Al combination. The installation of high-rate aeration to prevent sludge accumulation on the electrode surface markedly reduced residence times and enhanced the COD removal in the pharmaceutical effluent. However, this implementation potentially reduced the process efficiency for thesynthetic textile effluent as prolonged operation led to flocculation breakdown and subsequent re-dissolution of the contaminants in the water.	10.55815/431821	\N	\N	\N	Afinidad.

This meta-study determines the optimal MFC configuration for electricity production, through consideration of the biocatalyst and substrate used. This study focuses primarily on comparing the use of mixed microbial consortia to pure strains of biocatalyst, and the use of waste water in contrast to simple substrates such as; acetate, glucose, and lactate. The use of algae as a substrate, and as a biocatalyst, is also investigated. In this study, only single and dual chamber MFCs are compared, and power density standardised to anode surface area (mW/m2) is used as a metric to facilitate the comparison of different experimental setups. This meta-study shows that dual chamber MFCs, using simple substrates, when catalysed by mixed culture biocatalysts, produce greater power densities, than algae, and complex substrates, with average power densities of 280, 70 and 30 (mW/m2) observed respectively. In single chamber MFC configurations, mixed culture biocatalysts have been observed to yield approximately double the power output of pure culture biocatalysts.	10.5130/pamr.v5i0.1496	\N	\N	\N	PAM Review Energy Science &amp; Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.5130/pamr.v5i0.1496	["mixed culture"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.691	2025-07-08 18:39:37.455	\N	\N

The membraneless microbial fuel cell (ML-MFC) system was developed to avoid the use of membranes that are prone to clogging and are less applicable. The reactor was made and arranged in two chambers connected by pipes and the fluid flow rate is set using a peristaltic pump. Three anodes (carbon cloth) were paired with a carbon-Pt cathode GDL (Gas Diffusion Layer) type. The reactor was applied to wastewater taken from the industrial WWTP unit at the point before and after UASB. ML-MFC reactors can produce currents of 0.2 mA (before UASB) and 0.25 mA (after UASB). Current production is strongly influenced by the flow rate and characteristics of wastewater. Increased flow rates and complex character of wastewater will reduce current production. The electric power produced is 0.035 mwatt for wastewater before UASB and 0.086 mwatt after UASB with a COD removal is close to the same, which is 21% at a flow rate of 11 L / min1	10.1051/e3sconf/202020210006	\N	\N	2020-01-01 00:00:00	E3S Web of Conferences	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202020210006	\N	["carbon cloth"]	["Pt","carbon","gas diffusion","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.726	2025-07-08 18:39:56.533	\N	\N

However, few studies revealed the high electricity generation and pollutant removal using a large-scale single-chambered MFC in treating swine wastewater. Results indicated optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of swine wastewater was 8 d considering the removal efficiency and the power density. Under this condition, this MFC system removed 85.62% TCOD and 73.6% NH3 as well as achieved power density of 368 mW/m2. Results also showed the maximum power density of the MFC was 382.5±10.6 mW/m2 MFC at 350 Ω. TCOD concentration in the swine wastewater was limiting factor for power output. The maximum power density was Pmax= 385 mW/m2, with a half-saturation concentration of Ks=2,050 mg/l. To our knowledge, this is the first time to demonstrate the electricity characteristics of a large-scale single-chambered MFC in treating swine wastewater.	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.953-954.158	\N	\N	2014-06-17 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.953-954.158	\N	\N	["Pt","Fe"]	368000	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:21.262	2025-07-08 18:40:10.599	\N	\N

The presence of hazardous substances in pharmaceutical wastewater is a matter of global concern due to its association with multiple disorders, including disruptions in endocrine hormones and significant chronic toxicity. As research in this field continues to grow, the valorization to nanotechnology‐based treatment of industrial wastewater approaches. One prominent focus of recent research is the utilization of nanomaterials, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs), in treating pharmaceutical wastewater, aligns with the goals of sustainable development. CNTs demonstrate potential in efficiently mineralizing pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater, offering cost‐effectiveness, ease of handling, and efficacy. Additionally, CNTs possess the capability to remediate pharmaceutical wastewater at a relatively low cost, with the advantage of being recyclable. This review provides an overview of the diverse applications of various CNTs for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater, emphasizing the mechanisms of adsorption and degradation of these compounds using CNTs. Furthermore, it sheds light on the application of CNTs in photocatalysis as an economically viable and efficient solution.	10.1002/rem.21776	\N	\N	2024-01-31 23:00:00	Remediation Journal	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/rem.21776	\N	["GO","carbon nanotube","CNT"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.765	2025-07-08 18:39:45.767	\N	\N

Outer membrane c-type multi-heme cytochromes play a critical role in mediating this electron transport. The abundance of these cytochromes on the cell surface has also been hypothesized to facilitate long-distance electron transport along multicellular biofilms, in a manner similar to redox active polymers containing discrete redox moieties. Here we report measurements of electron transport in living S. oneidensis biofilms that bridged interdigitated array (IDA) microelectrodes. Electrochemical gating reveals a peak in the conduction current at the expected formal potential of the cytochrome conduits, consistent with redox conductivity where transport is driven by a multistep electron hopping mechanism through the heme network. The temperature dependency of the biofilm conduction is also consistent with such a thermally activated process, where conductivity increases with increasing temperature. In addition, the measured activation energy (0.315 eV) is consistent with the computationally-determined activation energy of the S. oneidensis Mtr decaheme cytochromes.	10.1149/ma2018-01/35/2092	\N	\N	2018-04-12 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2018-01/35/2092	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis","S. oneidensis"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.805	2025-07-08 18:40:01.143	\N	\N

Temperature-phased (mesophilic-ambient) process configurations in which can achieve either better effluent quality (i.e. maximizing treatment) or high energy recoveries is schematized. The performance used in the mass balance analysis of the treatment process conducted here compared with typical values in conventional biological wastewater treatment. Various advantages of using MFCs for wastewater treatment, including energy saving, less sludge production (and perhaps the lack of a need for a secondary clarifier), and no need for sludge handling, etc., were also addressed.	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.684.230	\N	\N	2013-03-31 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.684.230	\N	\N	["Pt","air cathode","Fe"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:29.893	2025-07-08 18:40:14.52	\N	\N

cmcuvig4t01qffcxo1ok0lh2w	Wastewater Treatment of Tofu Industry Using Microbial Fuel Cell Method	["Anwar Ma'ruf","Tia Anggraeni"]	<jats:p>Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a system for generating electrical energy by utilizing the interaction of bacteria with substrate. MFC generates electricity by oxidizing organic matter with the help of microbes. In this study, the substrate is tofu wastewater and cow rumen bacteria. The MFC used is a dual chamber equipped with a TiO2 clay ceramic membrane. This study aimed to determine the production of electrical energy from tofu liquid waste substrate using MFC technology with the addition of nutrients in the form of urea and bacteria from the cow's rumen. The variation of the ratio of tofu liquid waste used is 20%. 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. While the variations in the concentration of urea used were 1 - 5 grams. The results show that the greater the variation in the ratio of tofu liquid waste, the greater the energy potential. The highest average electric power is 381 volts from the 100% tofu liquid waste ratio. In addition, the greater the urea concentration the more it produces a large energy potential. The highest average electric power is 421 volts from 5 grams of urea concentration. The TiO2 clay ceramic membrane in the MFC system was able to reduce the TSS and TDS values ​​of tofu liquid waste. The highest percentage decrease for TSS is 37% and for TDS is 25% at the variation of the ratio of tofu liquid waste 100%.</jats:p>	10.30595/rice.v3i2.225	\N	\N	2024-12-30 23:00:00	Research in Chemical Engineering (RiCE)	\N	\N	\N	["MXene AND \\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.30595/rice.v3i2.225	\N	\N	["Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:32.237	2025-07-08 23:49:24.653	\N	\N
cmcuvifhx01pjfcxo2k71qxkz	Soil Microbial Fuel Cell with Hydrophilic Treated Buckypaper Anodes	["Soichiro Hirose","Trang Nakamoto","Kozo Taguchi"]	<jats:p>Fossil fuels, the primary source of energy supply in modern society, are both unsustainable and damaging to the environment. The most cost-effective way to reduce the use of fossil fuels is to switch to renewable energy sources. Soil microbial fuel cells (SMFC) are a green energy production method because they use electron-generating bacteria in the soil to obtain electrical energy from organic matter. One way to improve the output of SMFCs is to increase the specific surface area of the anodes. The larger specific surface area allows more electrons to be received from the bacteria. In this study, bucky paper (BP) was utilized as the anode of SMFC. BP is a freestanding film fabricated from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) by vacuum filtration method. CNT has a high specific surface area and electrical conductivity. BP is also considered to be mechanically stable in soil due to its CNT network structure. However, the surface of the BP is hydrophobic. In SMFCs, the hydrophobic surface of the anode is a fatal disadvantage in terms of the affinity of microorganisms. Thus, heat treatment and UV ozone treatment were employed to make the surface of BP hydrophilic, and their output in SMFCs was investigated. As a result, SMFCs using UV-ozone-treated BPs as anodes produced the highest power density of 28.8 μW/cm². Also, unlike thermal treatment, UV ozone treatment did not damage the CNT structure. Hence, in this experiment, the output power of the SMFC was stable for at least 140 hours.</jats:p>	10.21625/resourceedings.v3i2.998	\N	\N	2023-09-29 22:00:00	Resourceedings	\N	\N	\N	["MXene AND \\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.21625/resourceedings.v3i2.998	\N	["carbon nanotube","CNT"]	["carbon","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:31.414	2025-07-08 23:49:24.765	\N	\N
cmcu98odn0190jyupbwgwbrq6	Multifaceted regulation of siderophore synthesis by multiple regulatory systems in Shewanella oneidensis	["Peilu Xie","Yuanyou Xu","Jiaxin Tang","Shihua Wu","Haichun Gao"]	AbstractSiderophore-dependent iron uptake is a mechanism by which microorganisms scavenge and utilize iron for their survival, growth, and many specialized activities, such as pathogenicity. The siderophore biosynthetic system PubABC in Shewanella can synthesize a series of distinct siderophores, yet how it is regulated in response to iron availability remains largely unexplored. Here, by whole genome screening we identify TCS components histidine kinase (HK) BarA and response regulator (RR) SsoR as positive regulators of siderophore biosynthesis. While BarA partners with UvrY to mediate expression of pubABC post-transcriptionally via the Csr regulatory cascade, SsoR is an atypical orphan RR of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily that activates transcription in a phosphorylation-independent manner. By combining structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, we observe conformational changes in OmpR/PhoB-like RRs that illustrate the impact of phosphorylation on dynamic properties, and that SsoR is locked in the ‘phosphorylated’ state found in phosphorylation-dependent counterparts of the same subfamily. Furthermore, we show that iron homeostasis global regulator Fur, in addition to mediating transcription of its own regulon, acts as the sensor of iron starvation to increase SsoR production when needed. Overall, this study delineates an intricate, multi-tiered transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory network that governs siderophore biosynthesis.	10.1038/s42003-024-06193-7	\N	\N	\N	Communications Biology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06193-7	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis"]	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.811	2025-07-08 18:39:37.079	\N	\N

Our hypothesis is that the rate of deposition is proportional to both composition of the outer cell membrane and the bulk concentration. We also suggest that ionic strength and ion identity can affect the efficiency of sticking after initial encounter. Shown here are electrochemical studies on effect of salt concentration on S. oneidensis MR-1 attachment and growth at ITO electrodes. Initial surface coverage of bacteria can be measured with respect to four metric. One metric is the observed lag time before currents increase during bacterial loading at the ITO surface. A second one is the current associated with that lag time. The third is the maximum anodic current that occurs after the lag period. Finally a cyclic voltammetric experiment following loading has a metric associated with the cathodic peak current. The peak current is very large for NaCl compare to CsCl. The final coverage (as measured by cathodic peak current in cyclic voltammetry, ipc) increases with increasing ionic strength (IS). We suggest that the behavior of cathodic peak current is very sensitive to the salt concentrations and bacteria harvest time. Our results clearly show a major difference in attachment and behavior of S. oneidensis MR-1 for NaCl compared to CsCl. CsCl inhibits all four metrics associated with loading at +0.2 vs Ag/AgCl (lag time, lag current, maximum loading current and cyclic voltammetric peak current).	10.1149/ma2018-01/44/2541	\N	\N	2018-04-12 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2018-01/44/2541	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis","S. oneidensis"]	["GO"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.809	2025-07-08 18:40:01.168	\N	\N

Many physical and chemical remediation approaches have been proposed to deal with this pollution, but these are very time-consuming and costly. While bioremediation stands out as an inexpensive and efficient approach, the use of bacteria is thought to be a potential and productive organism to prevent this pollution.

The designed reactor consisted of three zones, namely a lower anaerobic digestion zone, a central MFC zone, and an upper effluent clarifier zone. Tests were conducted in batch mode using a beer wastewater as the fuel/electron donor (COD concentration: 430 mg/L) and mixed consortia (both sewage microflora and anaerobic sludge) as a source of electrogenic bacteria. A stable current density of ∼2,270 mA/m2 was generated under continuous polarization with a constant external resistance (0.01 kΩ) and cell polarization gave a peak power density of 330 mW/m2 at a current density of 1,680 mA/m2. Electrochemical impedance analysis showed that the overall internal resistance of the reactor was quite low, that is, 8.0 Ω. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the anodic biofilm at low scan rate revealed quite complex processes at the anode, with three redox peaks, at potentials of 116, 214, and 319 mV (vs. NHE). Biotechnol.

cmcuvhzed01bpfcxo27yx0zev	Potential of Electric Power Production from Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) in Evapotranspiration Reactor for Leachate Treatment Using Alocasia macrorrhiza Plant and Eleusine indica Grass	["Badrus Zaman","Irawan Wisnu Wardhana"]	<jats:p>Microbial fuel cell is one of attractive electric power generator from nature bacterial activity. While, Evapotranspiration is one of the waste water treatment system which developed to eliminate biological weakness that utilize the natural evaporation process and bacterial activity on plant roots and plant media. This study aims to determine the potential of electrical energy from leachate treatment using evapotranspiration reactor. The study was conducted using local plant, namely <jats:italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza</jats:italic> and local grass, namely <jats:italic>Eleusine Indica</jats:italic>. The system was using horizontal MFC by placing the cathodes and anodes at different chamber (i.e. in the leachate reactor and reactor with plant media). Carbon plates was used for chatode-anodes material with size of 40 cm x 10 cm x1 cm. Electrical power production was measure by a digital multimeter for 30 days reactor operation. The result shows electric power production was fluctuated during reactor operation from all reactors. The electric power generated from each reactor was fluctuated, but from the reactor using <jats:italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza</jats:italic> plant reach to 70 μwatt average. From the reactor using <jats:italic>Eleusine Indica</jats:italic> grass was reached 60 μwatt average. Electric power production fluctuation is related to the bacterial growth pattern in the soil media and on the plant roots which undergo the adaptation process until the middle of the operational period and then in stable growth condition until the end of the reactor operation. The results indicate that the evapotranspiration reactor using <jats:italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza</jats:italic> plant was 60-95% higher electric power potential than using <jats:italic>Eleusine Indica</jats:italic> grass in short-term (30-day) operation.

Etcheverry","E Desmond","A Bridier","T Bouchez","A Bergel"]	The removal of the total organic load (COD) from urban wastewater was studied in different bio-electrochemical systems (BES): microbial electrolysis, microbial fuel cell (MFC), and microbial electrochemical snorkel (MES). Here is presented the concept of MES [1], a simplified design of a “short-circuited” MFC. The MES cannot provide current but it is optimized for wastewater treatment. Technically, the MES concept can simply consist of a single piece of conductive material on which there are (i) one end colonised by an electro-active biofilm acting as a microbial anode (anaerobic zone), and (ii) one end covered with oxygen (bio- or not) electro-catalyst that ensures electron removal to the final electron acceptor and allows bacteria “snorkelling” to oxygen. Unlike MFCs, a MES does not divert energy to produce electricity but it ensures maximum efficiency for the oxidation of organic matter. COD removal comparison with the different BES was made starting from optimized graphite based microbial anodes already working at steady state rate of oxidation. Optimization of microbial anodes consisted of immersing a microbial anode already colonized with electoactive microorganisms together with a second polarized clean electrode resulting in the formation of an electroactive biofilm on the clean electrode that became more effective than the initial one. This strategy multiplied the current provided by the second electrode by a factor ranging from 2 to 20 in respect to the initial one. Comparative analysis of microbial diversity on electrodes was performed by pyrosequencing technology. Then, the comparative study using microbial anodes in different BES for the treatment of urban wastewater validated the MES concept since the MES process ensured about 75% of wastewater COD removal in less than 24 hours as well as a “short-circuited” MFC. In conclusion, the MES technology, which aims at maximizing the reaction rates by elimination of current generation, provided degradation performance far higher than the MFCs that operated at optimum power. This demonstration opens a new route for the design of extremely simple electro-microbial devices for wastewater treatment. [1] B. Erable et al., 2011.

The MFC was powered by Rhodopseudomonas palustris bacteria (R. palustris). An activated carbon sheet-based anode pre-loaded organic matter (starch) and R. palustris was used. By using starch in the anode, R. palustris-loaded on the anode could be preserved for a long time in dry conditions. The MFC could generate electricity on-demand activated by adding water to the anode. The activated carbon sheet anode was treated by UV-ozone treatment to remove impurities and to improve its hydrophilicity before being loaded with R. palustris.

cmcuvhk080141fcxometqbt67	(Invited) On Interpreting Polarization Curves for Microbial Fuel Cells – How Standard Fuel Cell Interpretations Do Not Apply	["Sudeep Popat"]	<jats:p> \tMicrobial electrochemical technologies (METs) represent a new class of electrochemical technologies in which one or more electrode reactions are catalyzed by microorganisms. The most common example of an MET is the microbial fuel cell (MFC). In MFCs, anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) catalyze the oxidation of simple organic molecules such as acetate, and respire to an anode, thus producing an electrical current. The electrons thus respired move through an external circuit to the cathode, where oxygen is reduced (non-biologically) to water. In this presentation, I will demonstrate through a decade of research I have been involved in how traditional interpretations of a typical fuel cell polarization curve do not apply to MFCs. For example, anodic polarization curves on ARB biofilms show that maximum current in produced with an overpotential of about 0.2 to 0.3 V. Any further increases in anode potential do not result in higher current densities, and the anodic polarization curve looks like it is dominated by a “mass transport limitation”; yet, no amount of higher substrate or buffer (to transport out the protons as a product of anode respiration) results in alleviation of this limitation. The limitation in current production is instead due to intracellular machinery in ARB that is optimized to respire to electron acceptors within a narrow range of redox potentials. On the other hand, cathode polarization curves show a large overpotential at low current densities, representative of “activation losses” as per standard fuel cell interpretations; yet these overpotentials, even for platinum-group metals when used in MFC cathodes, are larger than 0.5 V, which is unrealistic. The large cathodic overpotentials at low current densities are instead mass transport related losses that affect the cathode pH and thus the overall thermodynamics of the oxygen reduction reaction. Through a comprehensive understanding of the differences in overpotentials in MFCs in relation of typical fuel cell overpotentials, we can now begin to apply methods through which these could be overcome to design systems that would perform well as they are scaled up.  </jats:p>	10.1149/ma2019-02/50/2218	\N	\N	2019-08-31 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND graphene"]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2019-02/50/2218	\N	\N	["platinum","Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:50.6	2025-07-08 23:49:25.306	\N	\N

It is important to generate rapid, reliable and precise analytical information regarding CD105 levels. To establish a simple, selective and sensitive detection method, we prepared an immunosensor with novel bioconjugates based on Pt nanoparticles, thionin acetate and antibodies. The proposed immunosensor displayed a broader linear response to CD105, with a working range of 1.3 to 200.0 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.9 ng/mL under optimal conditions. Moreover, the studied immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity, fast analysis and adequate stability. The proposed methodology could readily be extended to other clinical- or environment-related biospecies.	10.3390/s121013471	\N	\N	2012-10-07 22:00:00	Sensors	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/s121013471	\N	\N	["Pt","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:34.263	2025-07-08 18:40:16.595	\N	\N

Brown-Malker","Sue Read","Andrew Rowlands","Justin Cooper-White","Jurg Keller"]	BioElectrochemical Systems are an emerging technology of interest. Central to the successful operation of these systems is the development of a biofilm on an electrode surface that facilitates the interaction of microorganisms capable of extra-cellular electron transfer. Porous graphite is typically chosen as the electrode material. However, other materials could contribute to a significant improvement in reactor performance. In order to evaluate these novel materials, a platform methodology is required. In this study, E-QCM-D was evaluated using a gold electrode, a mixed biofilm population and a challenging real influent (fermented solubilised sludge). The results gave real-time feedback on both the acoustic and electrochemical impedance of the working electrode, hence providing information about biofilm thickness, viscoelasticity, kinetics and mass transport. The use of E-QCM-D is novel for this field and has the potential to provide a wealth of new data to help optimise the performance of biofilms in these systems.	10.1149/1.3492222	\N	\N	2010-10-07 22:00:00	ECS Transactions	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1149/1.3492222	\N	["graphite","GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:35.998	2025-07-08 18:40:21.468	\N	\N

Dantas","Telma Simões","Yuri Y. Londer","P. Raj Pokkuluri","Carlos A. Salgueiro"]	The bacterium Gs (Geobacter sulfurreducens) is capable of oxidizing a large variety of compounds relaying electrons out of the cytoplasm and across the membranes in a process designated as extracellular electron transfer. The trihaem cytochrome PpcA is highly abundant in Gs and is most probably the reservoir of electrons destined for the outer surface. In addition to its role in electron transfer pathways, we have previously shown that this protein could perform e−/H+ energy transduction. This mechanism is achieved by selecting the specific redox states that the protein can access during the redox cycle and might be related to the formation of proton electrochemical potential gradient across the periplasmic membrane. The regulatory role of haem III in the functional mechanism of PpcA was probed by replacing Met58, a residue that controls the solvent accessibility of haem III, with serine, aspartic acid, asparagine or lysine. The data obtained from the mutants showed that the preferred e−/H+ transfer pathway observed for PpcA is strongly dependent on the reduction potential of haem III. It is striking to note that one residue can fine tune the redox states that can be accessed by the trihaem cytochrome enough to alter the functional pathways.	10.1042/bsr20120086	\N	\N	2013-01-31 23:00:00	Bioscience Reports	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20120086	["Geobacter","Geobacter sulfurreducens"]	\N	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:39.605	2025-07-08 18:40:14.825	\N	\N

Unfortunately, global power plants still using non-renewable energy sources. Consumption of fossil fuels harms the environment, while nuclear energy could release a significant amount of radioactive material. Besides the energy issues, the growth in population contributes to the high production of wastewater. Every year, the wastewater treatment industry consumes a high input of energy for treatment purposes. These issues invigorate research interest in microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology that can generate green power electricity while breaking down the organic matter in the wastewater. One of the research advancement in MFC is the air-cathode MFC that is scaled-up friendly due to its simple structure, and ability to utilize the abundance of oxygen in the air as the membrane and scaling up arrangements. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the main positive findings contributing to the recent improvement of air-cathode MFC and the obstacles faced for upscaling.</jats:p>	10.17576/jkukm-2020-32(4)-02	\N	\N	2020-11-29 23:00:00	Jurnal Kejuruteraan	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND graphene"]	https://doi.org/10.17576/jkukm-2020-32(4)-02	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","air cathode","Cu","iron","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:50.243	2025-07-08 23:49:25.338	\N	\N

Nevin","Derek R. Lovley"]	ABSTRACT Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is potentially an effective form of syntrophy in methanogenic communities, but little is known about the diversity of methanogens capable of DIET. The ability of Methanosarcina barkeri to participate in DIET was evaluated in coculture with Geobacter metallireducens . Cocultures formed aggregates that shared electrons via DIET during the stoichiometric conversion of ethanol to methane. Cocultures could not be initiated with a pilin-deficient G. metallireducens strain, suggesting that long-range electron transfer along pili was important for DIET. Amendments of granular activated carbon permitted the pilin-deficient G. metallireducens isolates to share electrons with M. barkeri , demonstrating that this conductive material could substitute for pili in promoting DIET. When M. barkeri was grown in coculture with the H 2 -producing Pelobacter carbinolicus , incapable of DIET, M. barkeri utilized H 2 as an electron donor but metabolized little of the acetate that P. carbinolicus produced. This suggested that H 2 , but not electrons derived from DIET, inhibited acetate metabolism. P. carbinolicus-M. barkeri cocultures did not aggregate, demonstrating that, unlike DIET, close physical contact was not necessary for interspecies H 2 transfer. M. barkeri is the second methanogen found to accept electrons via DIET and the first methanogen known to be capable of using either H 2 or electrons derived from DIET for CO 2 reduction. Furthermore, M. barkeri is genetically tractable, making it a model organism for elucidating mechanisms by which methanogens make biological electrical connections with other cells.	10.1128/aem.00895-14	\N	\N	2014-07-31 22:00:00	Applied and Environmental Microbiology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00895-14	["Geobacter"]	["activated carbon"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	2	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:40.389	2025-07-08 18:40:10.3	\N	\N

["Guangyi Zhang","Danxin Liang","Zisheng Zhao","Jingsa Qi","Long Huang"]	Tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) is a typical antibiotic pollutant with high toxicity and persistence. The degradation of TCH and the generation of the associated electron mediator in a dual chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were studied. The results of liquid chromatography revealed that TCH could be effectively removed (>93%) in MFCs mode. The maximum COD removal was 88.14&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.47% in MFCs while it was 69.57&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.36% in open circuit MFCs. According to cyclic voltammetry, the presence of the relevant redox peaks clearly suggested that the intermediates from TCH degradation could act as endogenous electron mediator. The highest power density of 120.02&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.76&#xa0;mW/m2 and the lowest internal resistance of 18.68&#xa0;&#x3a9; were achieved in MFC with 2&#xa0;mg/L of TCH. Microbial community analysis illustrated that Bacteroides, Comamonas, Clostridium_sensu_stricto, Desulfovibrio and Geobacter were enriched and played a dominant role in TCH degradation and power generation. Electrochemical active bacteria had certain tolerance to TCH and the inhibiting threshold value of TCH was below 5&#xa0;mg/L. This study provided a new thinking that low concentration of TCH could produce electron mediators to improve the performance of MFC system.	10.1016/j.envres.2021.112605	34958780	\N	2022-01-14 23:00:00	Environmental research	\N	\N	\N	["microbial fuel cell","power density"]	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112605	["Geobacter","Clostridium","Desulfovibrio"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	pubmed_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:04.036	2025-07-08 18:39:51.296	\N	\N
cmcu7wfu2001e1145bwe3nzen	Effects of different substrates on microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) anodic membrane: biodiversity and hydrogen production performance	["Qiongli Shao","Jianchang Li","Sixia Yang","Helin Sun"]	Abstract To investigate the effects of different substrates on the biodiversity and hydrogen production performance of microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) anodic membranes, the vital electroactive microorganisms (e.g. in MEC hydrogen production) were worth identifying. In the present study, single-factor experiments were performed. Sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as different substrates for MEC anodic culture experiments under the same condition. The effects of different substrates on the bioactivity, biomass and hydrogen production performance of MEC anodic films were analyzed. Also, the effects of different microbial communities on hydrogen production were studied using 16S rRNA sequencing. According to the experimental results, all the five substrates here can serve as hydrogen-producing raw materials for MEC. All indicators revealed that sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate are excellent biofilm culture materials. The serious acidification of glucose and starch was identified at the same substrate concentration, and the environment of the culture medium was difficult to control, which affected the growth and metabolism of electroactive microorganisms. In comparison, sodium acetate was the best, achieving a maximum output of 23.4 mA and a maximum hydrogen content of 25.85%. The other four were ranked as sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch. According to the results of high-throughput sequencing, when sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as substrates, the number of operational taxonomic units reached 464, 728, 636, 784, and 1,083, respectively. Furthermore, when MEC was cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate as substrates, the electroactive microorganism Desulfuromonas in the Proteobacteria would contribute the most to producing hydrogen. The relative abundance of the five substrates was ranked as sodium acetate > sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch, suggesting that the MEC anodic film cultured with sodium acetate as the substrate exhibited the best hydrogen production performance, and the starch showed the worst. It is noteworthy that Desulfuromonas was the most abundant species according to sequencing results. When glucose and starch served as substrates, they exhibited high biodiversity. The anodic membranes cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate were not as good as those cultured with glucose and starch, yet the electroactive microorganisms were up-regulated.	10.2166/wst.2019.107	\N	\N	2019-03-14 23:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2019.107	\N	["GO"]	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MEC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:37:34.251	2025-07-08 18:39:59.203	\N	\N

By electrical wiring of PSI and/or PSII with electrodes, the conversion of light energy into electrical power has been demonstrated. Different methodologies to electrically contact the photosystems with the electrodes have been developed, including the reconstitution of the photosystems on relay units, the application of redox‐active polymers as charge‐transport matrices, and the use of metallic nanoparticles or nanoclusters as electron‐transfer relays. Electrical contact of the photosystems with the electrodes facilitates charge separation of the redox intermediates generated upon illumination of the assemblies, thus retarding destructive back electron‐transfer reactions and enhancing the conversion of light energy into electrical power. Recent advances to fabricate electrically wired PSI and/or PSII electrodes are surveyed, and different approaches to assemble photo‐bioelectrochemical cells are discussed. The limitations and future perspectives of the systems will also be presented.</jats:p>	10.1002/celc.201402133	\N	\N	2014-08-20 22:00:00	ChemElectroChem	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND wastewater"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.201402133	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:25.356	2025-07-08 18:40:09.864	\N	\N
cmcuvhamv00w1fcxoxwsg38vt	Comprehensive evaluation of two different inoculums in <scp>MFC</scp> with a new tin‐coated copper mesh anode electrode for producing electricity from a cottonseed oil industry effluent	["Ergin Taşkan","Bestamin Özkaya","Halil Hasar"]	<jats:p>We evaluated a new electrode material for its capacity to generate electricity by using a cottonseed effluent in two microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Tin‐coated copper (Sn‐coating Cu) mesh and platinum‐coated titanium were used as anode and cathode electrode materials, respectively. For a startup period that allowed slow‐growing electro‐active bacteria to form biofilms on the anode electrode, inoculums were supplied from anaerobic digester sludge (ADS) and estuary sediment (ES). The ADS‐inoculated MFC successfully achieved maximum power density of 160 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, whereas ES‐inoculated MFC had a maximum power density of 59 mW/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Maximum columbic efficiencies for ADS and ES were 12.8% and 5.6% and the corresponding COD removal efficiencies were 66.6% and 53.6%, respectively. A PCR‐DGGE analysis showed that the anode surface in ADS‐inoculated MFC has more groups of bacteria than that in ES‐inoculated MFC. The kinetic performances of MFCs evaluated by using the Nernst–Monod equation showed that maximum current density (<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) increased to around 1.62 A/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the ADS‐inoculated MFC and 1.06 A/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the ES‐inoculated MFC. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 110–116, 2016</jats:p>	10.1002/ep.12207	\N	\N	2015-07-17 22:00:00	Environmental Progress &amp; Sustainable Energy	\N	\N	\N	["MFC AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/ep.12207	["sediment"]	["titanium"]	["platinum","copper","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:38.456	2025-07-08 23:49:25.779	\N	\N

cmcuvh58q00sxfcxok1opuz1m	Enhanced power generation in annular single‐chamber microbial fuel cell via optimization of electrode spacing using chocolate industry wastewater	["Parisa Noori","Ghasem Najafpour Darzi"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Development and practical application of microbial fuel cell (MFC) is restricted because of the limitations such as low power output. To overcome low power limitation, the optimization of specific parameters including electrode materials and surface area, electrode spacing, and MFC's cell shape was investigated. To the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been reported in the literature to implement an annular single‐chamber microbial fuel cell (ASCMFC) using chocolate industry wastewater. ASCMFC was fabricated via optimization of the stated parameters. The aspects of ASCMFC were comprehensively examined. In this study, the optimization of electrode spacing and its impact on performance of the ASCMFC were conducted. Reduction of electrode spacing by 46.15% (1.3–0.7 cm) resulted in a decrease in internal resistance from 100 to 50 Ω, which enhanced the power density and current output to 22.898 W/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and 6.42 mA, respectively. An optimum electrode spacing of 0.7 cm was determined. Through this paper, the effects of these parameters and the performance of ASCMFC are also evaluated.</jats:p>	10.1002/bab.1374	\N	\N	2015-07-03 22:00:00	Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND optimization"]	https://doi.org/10.1002/bab.1374	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:31.466	2025-07-08 23:49:26.075	\N	\N

The experimental data reported in a recent literature has been used for the validation of the models. The present models give prediction on the cell voltage and cell power density with 19–44% errors, which is less (up to 20%) than the errors on the prediction of cell voltage made in some recent literature for the same MFC where the effects of the difference in pH and ionic conductivity between anodic and cathodic solutions on cell voltage were not incorporated in model equations. It also describes the changes in anodic and cathodic chamber temperature due to the increase in substrate concentration and cell current density. Temperature profile across the membrane thickness has also been studied.</jats:p>	10.1515/green-2012-0027	\N	\N	2013-01-24 23:00:00	Green	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.1515/green-2012-0027	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:13.153	2025-07-08 23:49:26.564	\N	\N

Methylene blue (MB), neutral red (NR) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ) were selected as electrode mediators with different concentrations. A tin-coated copper mesh electrode was tested as anode electrode. Maximum power density of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) with 300 μM MB was 636 mW/m2. Optimal mediator concentrations with respect to the achieved maximum power output for MB, NR and HNQ were 300 μM, 200 μM and 50 μM, respectively.

However, they have low power output because of the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction at the cathode under neutral pH conditions. In this project, we developed a novel microbial fuel cell with a biocathode using cobalt oxidation and reduction, to determine whether a cobalt biocathode could increase power density more than the conventional manganese biocathode. We built three types of fuel cells; the control had only oxygen reduction in the cathode chamber. The second and third cells included manganese and cobalt, respectively, with oxygen reduction. Shewanella oneidensis was used to oxidize organic material at the anode chamber and Leptothrix cholodnii was used in the biocathode. We measured power output when the fuel cells had reached peak voltage under a limited glucose supply. We found that the cobalt biocathode resulted in a higher power density than the control group and the manganese biocathode, but took the longest to reach peak voltage, indicating that microbial biofilm formation takes longer when oxidizing cobalt than it does when oxidizing manganese.</jats:p>	10.59720/15-019	\N	\N	2014-12-31 23:00:00	Journal of Emerging Investigators	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.59720/15-019	["Shewanella","Shewanella oneidensis"]	\N	["Pt","Fe","Ni","biocathode"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:12.836	2025-07-08 23:49:26.591	\N	\N

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technologies were used to investigate the spatial distribution characteristics of bacterial community. The results showed that the MFC feeding with lactic acid obtained 0.57V of electromotive force, and 1.57 W/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of volumetric power density. It reached 0.62V and 2.07 W/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> when the carbon source was changed to acetic acid. Compared with anaerobic sludge, aerobic sludge had higher maximum voltage and longer high voltage duration. The stirring and the adding buffer solution improved electricity generation. SEM and DGGE profiles indicated that a large number of bacilli were tightly bound to the anode surface. Microbial community structure on the membrane surface was more similar to suspended sludge than sediment and seed sludge. In conclusion, MFCs perform better with incubating aerobic sludge, feeding acetic acid, adding PBS buffer (50mmol/L) and stirring.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.724-725.762	\N	\N	2013-08-15 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	["MFC AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.724-725.762	["anaerobic sludge","sediment"]	\N	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:39.263	2025-07-08 23:49:25.722	\N	\N

Enrichment by repeated transfer of a bacterial consortium harvested from the anode compartment of a MFC with synthetic media as a substrate increased the output from an initial level of 34 mA to a maximal level of 363 mA.

cmcv86xll00031yhibu1qwtny	Effect of Wall Boundary Layer Thickness on Power Performance of a Recirculation Microbial Fuel Cell	["Yan-Ming Chen","Chin-Tsan Wang","Yung-Chin Yang"]	<jats:p>Hydrodynamic boundary layer is a significant phenomenon occurring in a flow through a bluff body, and this includes the flow motion and mass transfer. Thus, it could affect the biofilm formation and the mass transfer of substrates in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Therefore, understanding the role of hydrodynamic boundary layer thicknesses in MFCs is truly important. In this study, three hydrodynamic boundary layers of thickness 1.6, 4.1, and 5 cm were applied to the recirculation mode membrane-less MFC to investigate the electricity production performance. The results showed that the thin hydrodynamic boundary could enhance the voltage output of MFC due to the strong shear rate effect. Thus, a maximum voltage of 22 mV was obtained in the MFC with a hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness of 1.6 cm, and this voltage output obtained was 11 times higher than that of MFC with 5 cm hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance of anode decreased with decreasing hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness. The charge transfer resistance of MFC with hydrodynamic boundary layer of thickness 1.6 cm was 39 Ω, which was 0.79 times lesser than that of MFC with 5 cm thickness. These observations would be useful for enhancing the performance of recirculation mode MFCs.</jats:p>	10.3390/en11041003	\N	\N	2018-04-19 22:00:00	Energies	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/en11041003	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:33:30.009	2025-07-09 00:33:30.009	\N	\N

Greenhalgh","Ahmad Kamal Ariffin"]	<jats:p>The potential use of MFC actuator as a tool for reducing low velocity impact induced delamination has been investigated using LS-DYNA explicit finite element code. An induced strain piezoelectric actuation model was implemented into LS-DYNA through its user defined material subroutine to simulate the piezoelectric effects while a cohesive based damage model was used to predict delamination. The numerical study confirmed that delamination could be reduced but the MFC required very high actuation voltages even in the case of very low energy impact which is not practically achievable with the existing actuator. Assuming powerful actuators are not something impossible in near future, this study provide useful information for advancing composite impact investigation using piezoelectric actuator as an integrated tool for improving its impact tolerance.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.165.346	\N	\N	2012-03-31 22:00:00	Applied Mechanics and Materials	\N	\N	\N	["MFC AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.165.346	\N	\N	["Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:39.845	2025-07-08 18:40:17.532	\N	\N

The MFC reactor showed power densities of 0.082 mW cm−2 and 0.031 mW cm−2 for the nano- and microstructured PANI anode, respectively. The results from electron microscopy scanning confirmed formation of the nanostructured PANI film on the anode surface and the results from electrochemical experiments confirmed that the electrochemical activity of the anode was significantly enhanced after modification by nanostructured PANI.

The barrier properties and formation of the layered films were investigated in relationship to the preparation procedures, combination of layers, and areal weight (basis weight). Characterization was done with respect to oxygen transmission rates (OTR), water vapor transmission rates (WVTR), tensile properties, and contact angles (CA) with water.

cmcuvg8yv005vfcxo96ekmnlv	Selectivity versus Mobility: Separation of Anode and Cathode in Microbial Bioelectrochemical Systems	["Falk Harnisch","Uwe Schröder"]	<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>During the operation of a microbial bioelectrochemical system, charge balance must be maintained between the anode and the cathode. In an ideal scenario, the charge balance would be realized by the unhindered migration of H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> or OH<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>. At the same time, any kind of diffusion (crossover) between both electrode compartments should be avoided. However, as several studies have demonstrated, the experimental reality does not match this ideal picture. Crossover processes occur and H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/OH<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> migration only plays an inferior role in the charge‐balancing ion transfer, which results in significant losses in the performance of the microbial bioelectrochemical system. This Minireview summarizes the conflict of selectivity versus mobility and discusses principle strategies to cope with the resulting constraints, including pH‐static operation and the use of different separator materials and membrane‐free systems. Finally, we show that every setup compromises either selectivity or mobility, and no apparent ideal solution currently exists.</jats:p>	10.1002/cssc.200900111	\N	\N	2009-10-11 22:00:00	ChemSusChem	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical system\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.200900111	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:49.639	2025-07-08 18:40:25.158	\N	\N

A magnet/glassy carbon (MGC) working electrode was used to accumulate immunocomplex associated magnetic beads and separate free and unbound reagents after liquid phase competitive immunoreaction among TCP antibody coated magnetic beads, TCP analyte and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled TCP. The activity of HRP tracers was monitored by square‐wave voltammetry (SWV) by scanning electrocactive enzymatic product in the presence of 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide (TMB‐H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) substrate solution. The electrochemical signal of enzymatic product was greatly enhanced by dual accumulation events: magnetic accumulation of enzyme tracers bound magnetic beads and constant potential accumulation of enzymatic product. The voltammetric characteristics of substrate and enzymatic product were investigated, and the parameters of SWV analysis and immunoassay were optimized. Under the optimal conditions the immunosensor was used to measure as low as 5 ng L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (ppt) TCP, which is 50‐fold lower than the value indicated by the manufacture of the TCP RaPID Assay kit (0.25 μg/L, colorimetric detection). The performance of the developed immunosensing system was successfully evaluated with river water samples spiked with TCP, indicating this convenient and sensitive technique offers great promise for decentralized environmental application. This technique could be readily used for detection of other environmental contaminants by developing specific antibodies against the contaminants and are expected to open new opportunities for environmental monitoring and public health.</jats:p>	10.1002/elan.200603563	\N	\N	2006-07-25 22:00:00	Electroanalysis	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical system\\""]	https://doi.org/10.1002/elan.200603563	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:49.587	2025-07-08 18:40:30.248	\N	\N

cmcuvg8ou005hfcxo0n170s2y	Nitrate and pesticide removal by a combined bioelectrochemical/adsorption process	["Z. Feleke","Y. Sakakibara"]	<jats:p>Biological denitrification and trace pesticide removal in a combined biofilm-electrode reactor/adsorption process has been investigated. In long-term (more than 260 days) continuous experiments, influent and effluent concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, isoprothiolane and gas composition were measured at different electric current and pesticide loading conditions. Experimental results showed that complete and stable denitrification was achieved in BER without accumulation of nitrite and nitrous oxide. Isoprothiolane (IPT) was removed by adsorption onto either granular activated carbon or silicone resin. Removal efficiency of IPT exceeding 97% was achieved and effluent concentration was below the guideline value (40 μg/l). Theoretically predicted effluent concentrations were in good agreement with the observed results. From these results, it is concluded that the combined process is applicable to treat nitrate and pesticide contaminated drinking water. Moreover, from comparison with former studies, different possible options to further enhance the decomposition of pesticide were suggested.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2001.0663	\N	\N	2001-05-31 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical system\\""]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2001.0663	\N	["GO","activated carbon"]	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:36:49.279	2025-07-08 18:40:32.533	\N	\N

Other established high energy-density liquid fuels, such as ethanol, are not yet amenable to direct electrochemical oxidation due to the lack of electrocatalysts for an efficient carbon-carbon bond scission. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A related fuel to methanol, with strong direct feed fuel cell potential is dimethyl ether (DME). DME possesses many of the same physical advantages that methanol does.<jats:sup>1-3</jats:sup> It is similar to methanol in terms of theoretical open cell voltage (1.18 <jats:italic>vs.</jats:italic> 1.21 V at 25°C) and does not require a carbon-carbon bond scission. DME is also a clean and, unlike methanol, nontoxic fuel that undergoes facile biodegradation and can be easily synthesized from recycled carbon dioxide and renewable energy.<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> Due to its lower dipole moment, DME is less subject to membrane crossover than methanol; it also has a higher energy content than methanol (8.2 vs. 6.1 kWh/kg).<jats:sup>5,6</jats:sup>Complete electro-oxidation of DME consumes 3 equivalents of water and yields 12 equivalents of electrons: </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> OCH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>+3H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O→2CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>+12H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>+12e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>      (1) </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>While the direct DME fuel cell (DDMEFC) performance has by now been demonstrated to match that of the state-of-the-art DMFC,<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> DDMEFC still requires development to become fully viable. In addition to the needed improvements in the anode catalyst activity, the catalyst deactivation and its durability continue to pose a challenge. Several aspects of optimization have been explored of which break-in has been one area of attention.<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation and initial break-in were carried out according to standard procedure.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> Prior to operation in the DDMEFC mode, the fuel cell was operated on humidified hydrogen/air to condition the membrane. When the current at 0.7 V plateaued the break-in was stopped, fuel cell polarization recorded on H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/air, and the anode feed switched to preheated, humidified DME under a pressure of approximately 1.75 bar gauge (2.56 bar absolute).<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>  Performance at this point reproduced previously observed performance on DME under similar conditions. Several DDMEFC polarization plots were recorded, leading a gradual performance loss. In an attempt to recover lost performance, the cell was switched back to break-in conditions on H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/air and after break in, DDMEFC polarization plots were recorded again. With each additional iteration of this procedure, the fuel cell performance increased, up to ~0.3 A cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> at 0.5 V after a thirteenth iteration (Figure 1). As a result of this conditioning, the DDMEFC power density achieved reached 0.18 W cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> – a 50% increase over the highest power density value reported in the literature with a commercial PtRu catalyst (0.12 W cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>).<jats:sup>7</jats:sup>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this presentation, we will provide details of the procedure used and discuss the causes of such a significant performance improvement. We will also comment on the DDMEFC performance durability in the context of the conditioning approach used in this study. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Acknowledgment</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Financial support from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy of the U.S. Department of Energy through Fuel Cell Technologies Office is gratefully acknowledged. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>REFERENCES</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1              Li, Q., Wu, G., Johnston, C.

cmcu7xqhz00321145bxs6g5u9	A New Method of Bio-Catalytic Surface Modification For Microbial Desalination Cell	["Ummy Mardiana"]	Microbial desalination cell (MDC) built on surface modification has been studied for seawater desalination. Herein, the bio-catalytic surface modification for maintenance the long-term MDC performance during desalination process has been developed. The goal of this study is to provide and develop a seawater desalination system without requiring energy support by applying a modification of anode as an electron acceptor, and the different potential charges that occur between anode and cathode can play as driving force for electrodialysis of seawater desalination. Yeast has been applied as biocatalyst, meanwhile neutral red has been chosen as redox mediator to facilitate the electron transport from bioactivity of cells. Several types of surface modification have been conducted, i.e. biocatalyst-mediator immobilization and electropolymerization of NR at the surface of the anode. The optimization of each device has been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and observed in Microbial fuel cell (MFC) prior functioned in MDC. The concentrations of salt ion migration have been determined by Ion Exchange Chromatography. MFC results reported that the best configuration of surface modification was obtained from CF/PNR then applied in MDC. CF/PNR delivered the highly significant performance by having the maximum value of all tested parameters, i.e 42.2% of current efficiency; 27.11% of bio-devices efficiency; 92.5 mA m-2 of current density and also 61% of NaCl transport. The profiles of surface devices have been detected by Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). A several spherical shapes around 4 nm within alginate layer have been detected from SEM images and it was confirmed as yeast, meanwhile 5.04% of N has been found from EDX spectrum and was indicated from PNR. The results show that surface modification could be a promising method for bioelectricity generation which simultaneously produces electricity and seawater desalination and provides a green chemistry technology.	10.14710/ijred.0.34235	\N	\N	2020-12-25 23:00:00	International Journal of Renewable Energy Development	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.14710/ijred.0.34235	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:38:34.728	2025-07-08 18:39:54.16	\N	\N

In this paper, different amounts of hydrophilic graphene oxide (GO) were doped into the modification layers to elevate the hydrophilicity of the G anodes so as to further improve their performance. Increasing the GO doped ratio from 0.15 mg·mg−1 to 0.2 mg·mg−1 and 0.25 mg·mg−1, the static water contact angle (θc) of the G-GO anodes decreased from 74.2 ± 0.52° to 64.6 ± 2.75° and 41.7 ± 3.69°, respectively. The G-GO0.2 anode with GO doped ratio of 0.2 mg·mg−1 exhibited the optimal performance and the maximum power density (Pmax) of the corresponding MFC was 1100.18 mW·m−2, 1.51 times higher than that of the MFC with the G anode.</jats:p>	10.3390/nano6090174	\N	\N	2016-09-14 22:00:00	Nanomaterials	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND graphene"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/nano6090174	\N	["graphene","graphene oxide","GO"]	["Pt","Fe"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:47.055	2025-07-08 23:49:25.599	\N	\N

Ibrahim"]	<jats:p>Melon seed husk (MSH) biochar was used in a single cell direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) as an alternative biofuel. The DCFCs belong to a generation of energy conversion devices that are characterised with higher efficiencies, lower emission of pollutants and MSH biochar as the fuel. Several analytical techniques (proximate, ultimate and thermo-chemical analysis) were employed to analyse the characteristics of the biomass fuel, their effects on the cell’s performance, and the electrochemical reactions between the fuel and the electrolyte in the system. High carbon content and calorific values are some of the parameters responsible for good performances. The performance of a lab-scale DCFC made of ceramic tubes using molten carbonate electrolyte was investigated. Binary carbonates mixture (Na2CO3-K2CO3, 38-62 mol.%) was used as electrolyte and the waste MSH carbonised at 450oC as biofuel. A practical evaluation of the fuel used in the DCFC system was conducted, for varying temperature of 100 - 800oC. The maximum open circuit voltage (OCV) was 0.71 V. With an applied load resistance and active surface area of 5.73 cm2 the maximum power density was 5.50 mWcm-2 and the current density was 29.67 mAcm-2 at 800oC.</jats:p>	10.4314/gjs.v61i2.4	\N	\N	2021-01-30 23:00:00	Ghana Journal of Science	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.4314/gjs.v61i2.4	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	crossref_comprehensive	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-09 00:56:54.001	2025-07-09 00:56:54.001	\N	\N
cmcuvj8vl027xfcxo80homyvb	Influence of Anode Potentials on Current Generation and Extracellular Electron Transfer Paths of Geobacter Species	["Souichiro Kato"]	<jats:p>Geobacter species are capable of utilizing solid-state compounds, including anodic electrodes, as electron acceptors of respiration via extracellular electron transfer (EET) and have attracted considerable attention for their crucial role as biocatalysts of bioelectrochemical systems (BES’s). Recent studies disclosed that anode potentials affect power output and anodic microbial communities, including selection of dominant Geobacter species, in various BES’s. However, the details in current-generating properties and responses to anode potentials have been investigated only for a model species, namely Geobacter sulfurreducens. In this study, the effects of anode potentials on the current generation and the EET paths were investigated by cultivating six Geobacter species with different anode potentials, followed by electrochemical analyses. The electrochemical cultivation demonstrated that the G. metallireducens clade species (G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens) constantly generate high current densities at a wide range of anode potentials (≥−0.3 or −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), while the subsurface clades species (G. daltonii, G. bemidjensis, G. chapellei, and G. pelophilus) generate a relatively large current only at limited potential regions (−0.1 to −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The linear sweep voltammetry analyses indicated that the G. metallireducens clade species utilize only one EET path irrespective of the anode potentials, while the subsurface clades species utilize multiple EET paths, which can be optimized depending on the anode potentials. These results clearly demonstrate that the response features to anode potentials are divergent among species (or clades) of Geobacter.</jats:p>	10.3390/ijms18010108	\N	\N	2017-01-05 23:00:00	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	\N	\N	\N	["Geobacter AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18010108	["Geobacter","Geobacter sulfurreducens","G. sulfurreducens"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:39:09.489	2025-07-08 23:49:24.234	\N	\N

The investigation of MFC incorporated with anaerobic mixed cultures and sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) membrane is of interest for this research due to its competency in generating renewable biological energy and wastewater treatment. Methylene blue was an effective redox mediator in this study. The reactor optimization was performed via the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach using Minitab software. The performance of the batch reactor was optimal with the operating conditions of temperature 30 °C, pH 7, and mediator concentration 250 μM. The contour plots and ANOVA specified that mediator concentration was the most influential parameter that affects MFC performance. MFC fed with 250 μM methylene blue concentration generated a maximum voltage of 0.33 V, current (density) of 4.08 A/m2, power (density) of 1.34 W/m2. The COD removal was 82.4 % at the end of the batch cycle of seven days. The data obtained from the experiments showed that small amounts of a mediator (250 μM) in wastewater elevate the bio-electricity output of the MFC reactor by 1.22 folds.	10.1515/ijcre-2023-0096	\N	\N	2024-02-15 23:00:00	International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1515/ijcre-2023-0096	["mixed culture"]	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	1340	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:03.942	2025-07-08 18:39:45.492	\N	\N

This study aims to optimize the amount of electrical voltage that can be generated through the SMFC system using stacked SMFC in the form of a series connection. The research methods include determining the sampling location, physical-chemical properties measurement of sediments, SMFC assembly (single and stacked SMFC), and electrical voltage measurement. Three station points representing the overall condition of Kendari Bay are determined as sampling locations. The result shows that there was a decrease in the organic matter content of the sediment substrate after the use of SMFC namely organic carbon from 2.78 percent to be 2.68 percent due to microbial activity in sediments. The single SMFC from station 2 (S2) can produce the maximum electrical voltage of 438 mV which then optimized using stacked SMFC in series connection. The maximum electrical voltage of 2.174V can be obtained using stacked SMFC. These results show that marine sediments of Kendari Bay is interesting as an alternative energy source through SMFC and stacked SMFC could optimize the amount of electrical voltage from single SMFC.	10.1088/1742-6596/1450/1/012111	\N	\N	2020-01-31 23:00:00	Journal of Physics: Conference Series	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1450/1/012111	["sediment"]	\N	["Pt","carbon","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 07:39:00.978	2025-07-08 18:39:56.124	\N	\N

cmcv9110d001x14fe9bycg0e1	Optimization of Cathode Catalyst Layer Composition of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell for Maximum Cell Performance Using Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithm	["Van Lap Nguyen","Agnesia Permatasari","Magnus So","Takeru Yano","Gen Inoue"]	<jats:p>  \tThe Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) is a promising technology for power generation, noted for its potential as a zero-carbon technology at the point of use. However, PEMFC faces challenges that must be addressed to enhance its viability, such as its high cost and inefficient output power density. A key component influencing these factors is the cathode catalyst layer (CCL), which is critical for the mass transport flux and electrochemical reactions within the fuel cell. A strategy to lower costs while maintaining performance involves optimizing the CCL composition, including the ionomer-to-carbon (I/C) ratio, Pt-to-carbon (Pt/C) ratio, CCL thickness, and the type of carbon black used, alongside minimizing the Pt loading. Such optimization involves consideration of multiple factors and, consequently, adjusting the CCL composition might have a high potential to balance cost and performance. In this study, therefore, our goal is to propose an optimized catalyst composition that enables high-cell performance with low Pt loading. In particular, we integrated a surrogate machine learning model with an optimization algorithm to determine the optimization of CCL composition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The composition of each CCL is characterized by several variables, including the Pt/C and I/C, the thickness of the catalyst layer, the ionomer coating condition (uniform and non-uniform coatings), and the type of carbon used, which varied between porous (Ketjen) and non-porous (Vulcan) carbon [1]. These variables and output power density were assigned as input and output variables of the machine learning models, respectively. The dataset for the machine learning model was prepared by conducting cell performances with various CCL compositions by the multi-block method detailed in our previous work [2,3]. A total of 390 simulations were used as the dataset, with 312 data points used for training and 78 data points for testing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An assembled machine-learning algorithm known as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was employed to develop the surrogate model. To identify the optimal CCL composition that generates the highest output power density at a given Pt loading, the XGB-based surrogate model was integrated with an optimization algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA). In particular, the fitness of each individual within the GA population is determined by the XGB-based surrogate model, and the GA iteratively evaluates the fitness using operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation, to converge toward the composition that results in the highest power density.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The performance of the XGB-based surrogate model in predicting cell performance is validated by its root mean squared error (RMSE) and square correlation coefficient (R²) on the test set, which are 0.07 and 0.89, respectively. This means the cell performance can be predicted by the surrogate model. In the importance feature analysis, the I/C ratio, carbon type, and thickness were identified as the most important parameters of CCL structures. This suggests that we can reduce the Pt load by optimizing the I/C ratio, CCL thickness, and type of carbon black. From the GA results, an optimal starting Pt loading of 0.25 mg/cm² was refined by adjusting the I/C ratio to 0.95, selecting Vulcan as the carbon type, and setting the CCL thickness to 6.54 µm. Through optimization, the Pt load was successfully reduced to 0.198 mg/cm², while maintaining the same power density as the initial loading of 0.25 mg/cm². This outcome highlights the efficacy of the surrogate model and optimization approach in enhancing the cost-efficiency of PEMFCs without compromising their performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgments</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This research was supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan (grant number P20003-20001327-0).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] K.

cmcuvh72700uxfcxo766cnku0	Autonomous, Retrievable, Deep Sea Microbial Fuel Cell	["Kenneth Erich Richter","Robert George"]	<jats:p>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) work by providing bacteria in anaerobic sediments with an electron acceptor (anode) that stimulates metabolism of organic matter. The buried anode is connected via control circuitry to a cathode exposed to oxygen in the overlying water. During metabolism, bacteria release hydrogen ions into the sediment and transfer electrons extra-cellularly to the anode, which eventually reduce dissolved oxygen at the cathode, forming water.  The open circuit voltage is approximately 0.8 v. The voltage between electrodes is operationally kept at 0.4 v with a potentiastat. The current is chiefly limited by the rate of microbial metabolism at the anode. The Office of Naval Research has encouraged development of microbial fuel cells in the marine environment at a number of academic and naval institutions. Work at SPAWAR, a navy laboratory in San Diego, involves fuel cell design and testing, applications to low power Navy sensors, and studies of important environmental parameters that affect fuel cell performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Earlier work in shallow sediments of San Diego Bay showed that the most important environmental parameters that control fuel cell power output in San Diego Bay were total organic carbon in the sediment and seasonal water temperature. Parameters that we dismissed as unimportant were dissolved oxygen levels, light level, and initial sediment bacterial populations.  Parameters whose affect we could not separate were total organic carbon and grain size.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Current MFC work at SPAWAR includes extension of microbial fuel cell tests to the deep sea environment (&gt;1000 m) and, in parallel, testing microbial fuel cells in the laboratory under deep sea conditions. One question we are asking is whether MFC power output from deep water sediments repressurized and chilled in the laboratory comparable to those measured in situ. If yes, mapping the power potential of deep sea sediments may be made much easier, requiring sediment grabs and lab tests rather than deployment and retrieval of fuel cells. Another question we are asking is whether in situ temperature and total organic carbon in the deep sea sediment can predict MFC power. If yes, then we can make use of the large collection of publicly available, deep sea oceanographic measurements to make these predictions, foregoing expensive work at sea. These regressions will be compared to those derived from shallow water measurements.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In order to meet these goals we are pursuing a field effort to (1) deploy a microbial fuel cell in progressively deeper water, (2) record in situ power and temperature over several weeks, and (3) retrieve the fuel cell along with sediment samples for analysis. We are also pursuing a laboratory effort to (1) build a matching microbial fuel cell in a pressure vessel capable of matching the pressure and temperature of deep water, (2) capable of flushing the fuel cell with oxygenated water under pressure to allow equilibrium power production, and (3) stock the pressure vessel with deep water sediment in order to take measurements analogous to those in the field.

cmcu98nr6003gjyupt86kwcb5	Effect of Plants Morphological Parameters on Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell Efficiency	["Iryna Rusyn","Oksana Fihurka","Vasyl Dyachok"]	Background. Plant-microbial fuel cell (PMFC) is an innovative biotechnology for the environmentally safe bioelectricity generation. The widespread use of bioelectrical systems (biosystems) is hindered by their insufficient efficiency due to limiting knowings of the relationship between bioelectricity generation and features of their biotechnological components. Objective. Тhe purpose of this study was to analyze the role of the plants morphological parameters and structure features of biomodules on generation of bioelectricity. Methods. Biometric, biogravimetric, voltammetric, and statistical analysis methods were used to assess the relationship between plant`s accumulated mass of leaf and roots, multielectrode design of biosystem and bioelectricity generation. Results. PMFC based on sedge C. hirta with the largest accumulated total dry leaf/stem and root mass and also the rhizome-like and developed fibrous root system were characterized by the highest power output compared to other biosystems. The power density was 970 ± 22 mW m-2 PGA. The parallel stacking of biomodules leads to obtain current output about 108.7 mA. That is why the developed biotechnological systems can be recommended as a foundation for the development of power supply for WiFi microcontrollers that consume 100 mA or for charging batteries. Conclusions. Sedge С. hirta were appeared as the more suitable plants for biological component of biosystem of bioelectricity generation. Power density of С. hirta based PMFC exceeded the one of based on other plants in 9.3–37.9%.The type and level of development of the root system and of the above-ground photosynthetic surface of plant are an important prognostic factors of the PMFC perfomance. A 10-fold increase of the electrode surface of one biomodule results in 3.95 times increase of power density at 200 W. The multielectrodeity biomodule reveals as another lever for increasing the efficiency of biosystems which allows obtaining significantly increase power density and current density in the range of electrical resistance from 50 to 500 W.	10.20535/ibb.2022.6.3-4.273108	\N	\N	\N	Innovative Biosystems and Bioengineering	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.20535/ibb.2022.6.3-4.273108	["C. hirta"]	\N	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	970	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.002	2025-07-08 18:39:38.579	\N	\N

Chen"]	AbstractEnhancing the electrochemical performance of anode is a critical step for improving the power output of marine benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs). An active anode involving the akaganeite (β‐FeOOH)‐coated carbon felt was proposed in present study. Results showed that electrochemical performance of modified anode was significantly improved. The peak current density of oxidation reaction increased from 0.664 to 6.107 A m−2. The exchange current density was improved from 11.75 × 10−3 to 151.36 × 10−3 mA cm−2. Electron transfer resistance decreased from 13.4 to 1.407 Ω, while the surface capacitance dramatically increased. The maximum power density of the BMFCs equipped with modified anode approached to 504.2 mW m−2, 2.3 times higher than that with unmodified anode. Moreover, relative abundance of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB) on the modified anode increased. Finally, a molecule synergetic mechanism containing electrostatic interaction and bacteria recognition between DIRB and β‐FeOOH was proposed to interpret the improvement of modified anode.	10.1002/fuce.201800112	\N	\N	2019-03-31 22:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201800112	\N	["carbon felt"]	["carbon","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.027	2025-07-08 18:39:58.91	\N	\N

Logan"]	AbstractMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) and other bioelectrochemical systems are new technologies that require expertise in a variety of technical areas, ranging from electrochemistry to biological wastewater treatment. There are certain data and critical information that should be included in every MFC study, such as specific surface area of the electrodes, solution conductivity, and power densities normalized to electrode surface area and volumes. Electrochemical techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry can be used to understand the performance of the MFC, but extremely slow scans are required for these biological systems compared to more traditional fuel cells. In this Minireview, the critical information needed for MFC studies is provided with examples of how results can be better conveyed through a full description of materials, the use of proper controls, and inclusion of a more complete electrochemical analysis.	10.1002/cssc.201100604	\N	\N	2012-05-31 22:00:00	ChemSusChem	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201100604	\N	\N	["Pt","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:34.103	2025-07-08 18:40:17.25	\N	\N

Babauta","Haluk Beyenal"]	<jats:p>Model electrochemically active bacteria such as <jats:italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</jats:italic> are well-established and are often used to study microbial interactions within biofilms that transfer electrons to electrodes. In the presented work, we utilized a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) coupled to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to simultaneously monitor biofilm growth and the microbial interaction with the electrode. The QCM monitored the frequency shift from the background resonant frequency in real time while the current increased because of biofilm growth. At select times during biofilm growth, we halted the current and obtained biofilm impedance spectra. The short-term and long-term electrode interactions of <jats:italic>G. sulfurreducens</jats:italic> biofilms were demonstrated. In the short-term, the frequency shift was linear with respect to current for the biofilm. In long-term biofilm growth up to the exponential phase, a second linear region was observed. Biofilm impedance spectra taken across these times revealed a reproducible electrochemical signal. Conductance of the biofilm was linear with current whereas capacitance reached a limiting value towards the end of exponential growth. We show that a simple iV relationship can explain the linear behavior of conductance and current. Capacitance could be used to identify the transition between different growth phases. We compare the biofilm response on the QCM to capacitive, electrochemically-deposited polyaniline films. Our results suggest that the QCM can be used in applications where it is beneficial to identify electrochemically active bacteria that form efficient current-producing biofilms.</jats:p>	10.1149/ma2016-01/36/1814	\N	\N	2016-03-31 22:00:00	ECS Meeting Abstracts	\N	\N	\N	["Geobacter AND electrode"]	https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2016-01/36/1814	["Geobacter","Geobacter sulfurreducens","G. sulfurreducens"]	["polyaniline"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:39:05.911	2025-07-08 23:49:24.563	\N	\N

Developed at the beginning of 20-th century, regarding the significant achievements, MFCs are still “lab stage” devices. One way to overcome the “lab stage” is the materials characterization and optimization. Besides the necessity of well studied and understood bacterial behavior in MFCs, the knowledge of how materials and design, as well as design parameters are influencing MFCs performance is a main task placed in front of the researchers in this area. In the traditional fuel cells, the structure-to-property modeling is recognized as an effective approach to identify the key parameters influencing the system behavior and to discover the correlations between these parameters and the final characteristics. The same approach must be introduced in MFCs in order to address the questions that the conventional fuel cells faced and overcame years ago.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, structure-to-property relationship of different carbonaceous materials suitable for anode and cathode electrodes development have been developed in details and related to the performance of these electrodes was explored in real MFCs. Commercially available carbon paper (Toray® paper) was studied as material for anodes preparation. Surface parameters, such as wettability, porosity and roughness have been determined and related to the bacterial attachment and biofilm formation, as well as MFCs start up time. On the other end “home-made” activated carbon was studied as a material for the design of cathode electrodes and optimized varying the applied pressure and the magnitude of the temperature treatment step. These two parameters showed significant influence on the cathodes surface chemistry and morphology and thus on the cathodes electrochemical behavior. In both cases surface-to-property relationship approach was applied to understand the similarities and differences in the studied electrodes and highlight the properties that are important for improved MFCs performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Carbon paper (Toray® H-090) with different PTFE content (0, 20, 40 and 60%wt PTFE) was used as anode material. The results showed that the increase in PTFE content led to an increase in roughness in both macro (100-300 μm) and micro-scale (5-10 μm) along with an increase of the porosity at macro-scale underling the presence of higher number of large pores [2]. At the contrary, the higher PTFE content led to a lower number of small pores (5-10 μm) that are the one preferred by bacteria for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation [2]. The contact angles measured varied between 135° and 155°, showing high hydrophobicity independent from the PTFE amount. After immersion in wastewater for 2 weeks, the contact angle dropped dramatically to slightly hydrophobic or completely hydrophilic. This phenomenon was mainly due to biofilm attachment on the surface that enhanced the wettability of the materials. Variation of anodes weight over time was also monitored to correlate the materials surface properties to bacteria attachment and further biofilm formation. The materials lost their hydrophobicity proportionally to the PTFE content and due to that the Toray® carbon paper with low PTFE content (0 and 20%wt PTFE) had higher increase in weight (wet and dry) compared to the other materials tested (40 and 60%wt PTFE) (Fig. 1) [2]. The reason is the increased number of small pores, which enhanced biofilm formation. The start up trend followed the biofilm attachment with the faster start up achieved by the Toray® with no PTFE treatment (Fig. 1) [2]. All of these points out the importance of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties and surface morphology on biofilm formation and subsequently the start up period of MFCs [2].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Even more detailed study was carried out for the developed gas-diffusion cathodes based on activated carbon. In this case except the surface morphology parameters, the surface chemistry and charge transfer resistance were included in the surface-to-property study and correlated with the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. Significant dataset was collected and processed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a statistical tool for data analysis (Fig. 2).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The change in surface chemistry (determined using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) due to PTFE variation was found to have significant influence on the power output. The highest current was observed for samples with largest amounts of carbon oxides and oxygenated tetrafluroethylene (cathodes treated at 200°C).  At the contrary, the highest resistance as well as lowest performance was noticed for the sample having increased amount of fully fluorinated carbons. It was found out that the magnitude of the applied pressure also determines the resistance of the cathodes showing reverse proportionality. Based on this study we can conclude that a step forward in the MFCs development can be done only with detailed investigation of surface-to-property relationships. Further studies on materials towards deeper characterizations should be addressed and parameter considered until know as insignificant or completely ignored have to be examined. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] C.

cmcu98ns6005cjyup3cov6y6y	Electrochemical performance analysis of microbial fuel cells based on nanomaterials	["Jianzhang Li"]	The use of traditional fossil fuel energy has caused serious environmental pollution problems. It is becoming increasingly urgent to find a green and clean new energy source. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have attracted much attention due to their renewable capabilities and green characteristics. MFCs still has certain limitations in its application process, such as its internal complexity, high cost of electrode separators and unstable power generation. Introducing different types of nanomaterials to build MFCs can solve these existing problems. However, how the introduced nanomaterials improve the electrochemical properties of MFCs remains to be further analyzed. To this end, this research will discuss the mechanism by which different regulatory strategies based on nanomaterials alter the electrochemical behavior of MFCs. Specifically, this research will focus on the impact of nanomaterials-based modification on the electrochemical performance of MFCs, including structural changes, material composite and new material preparations. The results show that the introduction of nanomaterials significantly improves the power density, current density and stability of MFCs, while enhancing catalytic activity, microbial adhesion and electron transfer efficiency. In this research, the analysis of changes in the electrochemical properties of MFCs by nanomaterials is conducive to the synthesis of novel electrochemically active nanomaterials and the development of high-performance MFCs.	10.54097/8g79m059	\N	\N	\N	Highlights in Science, Engineering and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.54097/8g79m059	\N	\N	["Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.038	2025-07-08 18:39:38.525	\N	\N

Kumar"]	AbstractMicrobial fuel cell (MFC) technology has potential to generate bioelectricity. However, the low power density problem is considerably associated with anode materials and its performance. In this study, modified anodes for single chamber MFC (SMFC) have been developed using NiWO4 impregnated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (NWG) composite. The analytical and morphological properties of rGO, NiWO4 particles and NWG composites have been characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical activity and capacitance of modified anode(s) are determined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatics charge‐discharge, respectively. Modified NWG composite (2 mmol)‐carbon cloth (CC) anode has highest capacitance value of 47.27 ± 0.18 F cm−2. The maximum power density obtained by modified NWG composite (2 mmol)‐CC anode was observed to be 1128 ± 42 mW m−2 which was 6.57 times higher than the unmodified anode (171 ± 8 mW m−2). Electrochemical impedance spectra results indicate a substantial improvement in electron transfer between the microbes and the modified NWG composites‐CC anodes. The decrease in the internal resistance of SMFC system is observed due to the improved electrochemical capacitance and synergistic effect between NiWO4 and rGO. In conclusion, modified NWG composites‐CC anodes enhance the performance considerably and show excellent potential in electrode surface electrocatalyst modifier in MFCs.	10.1002/fuce.201800120	\N	\N	2019-05-31 22:00:00	Fuel Cells	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1002/fuce.201800120	\N	["carbon cloth","graphene","graphene oxide","GO","reduced graphene oxide","rGO"]	["carbon","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.031	2025-07-08 18:39:58.371	\N	\N

The proposed architecture enables the maximum power extraction from the first energy source, whereas the second source is disabled. However, once the first energy source is impaired (i.e., not working), the second energy source becomes the primary energy source in the architecture, and the first energy source is decoupled from the system. The measurement result of the proposed architecture, implemented with the off-the-shelf components and tested with two emulated MFCs, demonstrates a peak efficiency of 56.51%, which is the highest end-to-end efficiency among prior work. The proposed architecture can operate from a minimum input voltage of 0.3 V and simultaneously regulate two outputs to constant voltages of nearly 3.7 V and 5 V.</jats:p>	10.17798/bitlisfen.1491127	\N	\N	2025-03-25 23:00:00	Bitlis Eren Üniversitesi Fen Bilimleri Dergisi	\N	\N	\N	["MXene AND \\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.17798/bitlisfen.1491127	\N	\N	["Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:31.856	2025-07-08 23:49:24.71	\N	\N

With the introduction of additive manufacturing techniques, the development of a new generation of bioelectrodes with custom-shaped geometries using conductive composites has become feasible. This study examines the potential of using two conductive composites, Poly-lactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), for 3D-printed electrodes. Electrochemical characterization reveals that TPU has a charge transfer resistance approximately two orders of magnitude higher than PLA, rendering it unsuitable for bioelectrodes. The presence of triangular patterns enhances the performance of planar electrodes, with optimal results observed for PLA-based electrodes with surface pattern depths between 0.6 and 1.4 mm. Additionally, electrodeposition (ED) of graphene oxide (GO) further improves performance across all cases. During the subsequent biotic start-up, patterned PLA electrodes with a depth of 1.4 mm exhibit higher current. However, these 3D-printed electrodes exhibit degradation after 56 days of operation.	10.3390/app14167199	\N	\N	\N	Applied Sciences	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/app14167199	\N	["graphene","graphene oxide","GO"]	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.089	2025-07-08 18:39:38.447	\N	\N
cmcuviel601obfcxoejdz6c4b	Painted Electrode with Activated Coconut Carbon for Microbial Fuel Cell	["Paweł P. Włodarczyk","Barbara Włodarczyk"]	<jats:p>A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical system that utilizes electroactive microorganisms to generate electricity. These microorganisms, which convert the energy stored in substrates such as wastewater into electricity, grow on the anode. To ensure biocompatibility, anodes are typically made from carbon-based materials. Therefore, a carbon-based material (by-product of coconut processing) was selected for testing in this study. The anode was prepared by bonding activated coconut carbon with carbon paint on a glass electrode. The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of using an electrode prepared in this manner as a surface layer on the anode of an MFC. The performance of an electrode coated only with carbon paint was also evaluated. These two electrodes were compared with a carbon felt electrode, which is commonly used as an anode material in MFCs. In this research, the MFC was fed with a by-product of yeast production, namely a molasses decoction from yeast processing. Measurements were conducted in a standard two-chamber glass MFC with a glass membrane separating the chambers. During the experiment, parameters such as start-up time, cell voltage during MFC start-up, output cell voltage, and power density curves were analyzed. The carbon paint-coated electrode with the activated coconut carbon additive demonstrated operating parameters similar to those of the carbon felt electrode. The results indicate that it is possible to produce electrodes (on a base of by-product of coconut processing) for MFCs using a painting method; however, to achieve a performance comparable to carbon felt, the addition of activated coconut carbon is necessary. This study demonstrates the feasibility of forming a biocompatible layer on various surfaces. Incorporating activated coconut carbon does not complicate the anode fabrication process, as fine ACC grains can be directly applied to the wet carbon paint layer. Additionally, the use of carbon paint as a conductive layer for the active anode in MFCs offers versatility in designing electrodes of various shapes, enabling them to be coated with a suitable active and conductive layer to promote biofilm formation. Moreover, the findings of this study confirm that waste-derived materials can be effectively utilized as electrode components in MFC anodes. The results validate the chosen research approach and emphasize the potential for further investigations in this field, contributing to the development of cost-efficient electrodes derived from by-products for MFC applications.</jats:p>	10.3390/en18061350	\N	\N	2025-03-09 23:00:00	Energies	\N	\N	\N	["MXene AND \\"microbial fuel cell\\""]	https://doi.org/10.3390/en18061350	\N	["carbon felt"]	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:38:30.234	2025-07-08 23:49:24.796	\N	\N

This study assessed how bioelectrochemical systems could be used to enhance nitrate removal from waters with low organic carbon concentrations. A two-chamber microbial electrosynthesis cell (MES) was constructed and operated for 45 days with inoculum that was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A study showed that MES can be used to enhance nitrate removal efficiency from 3.66% day−1 in a control reactor to 8.54% day−1 in the MES reactor, if a cathode is able to act as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrifying bacteria or there is reducing oxygen in a cathodic chamber to favor denitrification. In the MES, greenhouse gas emissions were also lower compared to the control. Nitrous oxide average fluxes were −639.59 and −9.15 µg N m−2 h−1 for the MES and control, respectively, and the average carbon dioxide fluxes were −5.28 and 43.80 mg C m−2 h−1, respectively. The current density correlated significantly with the dissolved oxygen concentration, indicating that it is essential to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration in the cathode chamber as low as possible, not only to suppress oxygen’s inhibiting effect on denitrification but also to achieve better power efficiency.	10.3390/w12020516	\N	\N	\N	Water	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020516	\N	\N	["carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MES	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.136	2025-07-08 18:39:38.205	\N	\N

Microbial electrochemical technologies could be the key for these enterprises to exploit this current waste product. Whey removal and conversion to electrical current was investigated at microbial anodes using potentiostatically controlled half‐cell experiments. The anodes were fed with a whey solution containing ca. 1 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> COD. This can be reliably cleaned with average removal efficiencies of 65.8±10.9 %. The removal coincided with maximum current densities of 0.31±0.06 mA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and Coulomb efficiencies of 37.1±10.8 %. The anodes are based on a robust complex microbial community. This was established in bioelectrochemical reactors by end of four batch cycles showing an efficient niche differentiation from the following successive enrichments. The microbial analysis revealed a division of labour with mainly planktonic microorganisms degrading the complex whey components by fermentation to organic acids, part of which are subsequently used by the electroactive bacteria at the anode.

cmcu98nw400dhjyupjkbbdwrd	An agent-based modeling approach for simulating the impact of small unmanned aircraft systems on future battlefields	["Carsten Christensen","John Salmon"]	The increasing proliferation of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUASs) is forcing a paradigm shift in military doctrine surrounding counter-sUAS and sUAS deployment tactics. This work describes an agent-based model that incorporates established infantry small unit tactics with the ability to deploy sUASs to aid in surveillance and indirect fire targeting. The model is based on current military doctrine and real warfighter experiences and is presented as a foundation from which additional simulation capabilities and analyses may be created. A series of randomly generated situations sets a defending force with the potential to have sUAS capabilities against a superior attacking force without sUAS capabilities. A control case considers defenders without sUAS capabilities. In six experimental cases, defending forces deploy a single sUAS in one of six patrol patterns as a surveillance and indirect fire targeting tool. Subsequent analysis reveals that sUASs generally increase the odds of defender survival during an engagement and that short-range, concentrated patrol patterns lead to higher odds of defender survival and increased indirect fire opportunities. A battery of analyses showcase the model’s capabilities in terms of exploring novel sUAS implementation strategies and illustrating the impact of those strategies over a range of combat effectiveness metrics.	10.1177/1548512920963904	\N	\N	2022-06-30 22:00:00	The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation: Applications, Methodology, Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1177/1548512920963904	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.181	2025-07-08 18:39:50.279	\N	\N

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are distinctive because of their ability to transform organic waste into electricity through bio-electrochemical reactions. The current study investigates the preparation and application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and sulfonated ZnO nanoparticles (SZnO NPs) incorporated in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membrane as a separator in dual-chambered MFC for Tannery wastewater treatment. Characterization of these membranes shows that the NPs are well dispersed onto the polymer base. The synthesized sulfonated membrane has better water uptake capacity (90.5%) and oxygen mass transfer coefficient (1.09 × 10−6 cm·s−1) than the Nafion membrane water uptake capacity (21.8%) and oxygen mass transfer coefficient (2.68 × 10−4 cm·s−1). Different amounts of NPs were incorporated into the polymer base to optimize the membrane performance by increasing the proton conductivity for better operation in MFC with reduced biofouling. When the MFC was operated with tannery wastewater, a maximum power density of 160.554 mW·m−2 and a chemical oxygen demand removal of 84.618% were obtained using the PVA–SZnO membrane with reduced biofouling. This observation proves that the sustainable and affordable PVA–SZnO membrane can be used as a separator for MFC and for treating Tannery wastewater.	10.1515/rams-2025-0106	\N	\N	2025-05-20 22:00:00	REVIEWS ON ADVANCED MATERIALS SCIENCE	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1515/rams-2025-0106	\N	\N	["Pt","carbon","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.199	2025-07-08 18:39:41.943	\N	\N
cmcu98nxm00gtjyupjpmln1mj	(Invited)  Beyond Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy: Advanced Methods for Studying the Dynamics of Electrochemical Processes	["Tanja Vidakovic-Koch"]	The most popular technique for characterizing various electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, water electrolysis or batteries is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). However, due to the coupling of dynamic phenomena with similar time constants, EIS often fails to separate the contributions of individual processes to overall performance losses. In this case, obtaining useful information from the EIS spectra can be be difficult and the interpretation of the observed patterns is unclear. In this talk, I show that new dynamical methods based on the use of nonlinearities in the system response (nonlinear frequency response analysis (NFRA) [1]), non-electrical inputs (concentration-alternating frequency response analysis (cFRA) [2]), or data-driven analyses (Loewner framework [3]) can provide additional information for understanding electrochemical conversion processes. Our current examples are related to the study of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell.

These fields of science and technology constitute interdisciplinary fields that cover physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, leading, as a wanted output, to the elucidation of physical and chemical properties, as well as structures, fabrication, and performance evaluation of devices and the creation of new knowledge underlying the operation of organic devices using new synthesized organic materials—organic semiconductors. We testify the situation when the available organic electronic applications sometimes lack a theoretical background. The cause may be the complicated properties of disordered, weak bounded, molecular materials with properties different from their inorganic counterparts. One of the basic information-rich resources is the electronic structure of organic semiconductors, elucidated by the methods, hardly possible to be transferred from the branch of inorganic semiconductors. Electrochemical spectroscopic methods, in general, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in particular, tend and seem to fill this gap. In this Perspective article, the energy resolved-electrochemical impedance spectroscopic method for electronic structure studies of surface and bulk of organic semiconductors is presented, and its theoretical and implementation background is highlighted. To show the method’s properties and strength, both as to the wide energy and excessive dynamic range, the basic measurements on polymeric materials and D–A blends are introduced, and to highlight its broad applicability, the results on polysilanes degradability, gap engineering of non-fullerene D–A blends, and electron structure spectroscopy of an inorganic nanocrystalline film are highlighted. In the outlook and perspective, the electrolyte/polymer interface will be studied in general and specifically devoted to the morphological, transport, and recombination properties of organic semiconductors and biophysical materials.	10.1063/5.0022289	\N	\N	2020-10-21 00:00:00	Journal of Applied Physics	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0022289	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.225	2025-07-08 18:39:54.701	\N	\N

Baughman","Yongsheng Chen"]	<jats:p> \tLow energy density of energy storage devices such as supercapacitors<jats:sup>1-5</jats:sup> and thermocells<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> has always been a problem to be solved urgently, which is due to the low specific surface area and low density of the electrode materials. The graphene based materials with high surface area have successfully increased the energy density of energy storage devices, but the density of graphene materials is still low, which leads to low energy density based on the weight of the whole devices. Currently most efforts have been focused on increasing the specific surface area of graphene materials, instead of increasing the density of graphene. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Herein, we have successfully synthesized graphene based materials with both high specific surface area and density. Phenolic precursors were in-situ polymerized on the surface of graphene 3D network through the hydrothermal reaction. The mass ratio between the phenolic precursors and graphene oxide was varied from 1:4 to 1:100. The results indicated that when the mass ratio between the phenolic resin precursor and graphene oxide is 1:16, graphene based 3D cross-linked nano-composites with high density can be realized. The corresponding specific surface area is 700 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g and the density is 0.55 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>; Chemical activation by using activation agents to the as-prepared products was performed for the further increasing of the surface area. Different activation agents such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium carbonate were used, in which the chemical activation effect is the best for potassium hydroxide is the best. The optimal mass ratio between potassium hydroxide and Intermediate products ratio is 4:1, while the optimized activation temperature is 900 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. The optimized graphene based materials have the specific surface area up to 3000 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g and the density about 0.5 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which was used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors and thermocells<jats:sup>3,6</jats:sup>. Supercapacitors based on our materials exhibited a high energy density of 90 wh/kg in organic electrolyte, which is much higher than 54 wh/kg for supercapacitors based on the commercial activated carbon. Thermocells based on our materials achieved a output power of 12 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, which is also much higher than 2 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for thermocells based on the traditional carbon materials. This project provides a key material for energy storage devices to achieve high energy density and output power. Furthermore, it will strongly promote the research and development of supercapacitors and thermocells for their application in the area of small ignition device and harvesting the low-grade and wasted thermal energy. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Reference: </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> (1) <jats:bold>Long Zhang</jats:bold>; Xi Yang; Fan Zhang; Guankui Long; Tengfei Zhang; Kai Leng; Yawei Zhang; Yi Huang; Yanfeng Ma; Mingtao Zhang; Yongsheng Chen*.

Rillig"]	Abstract Anthropogenic activities impose multiple concurrent pressures on soils globally, but responses of soil microbes to multiple global change factors are poorly understood. Here, we apply 10 treatments (warming, drought, nitrogen deposition, salinity, heavy metal, microplastics, antibiotics, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides) individually and in combinations of 8 factors to soil samples, and monitor their bacterial and viral composition by metagenomic analysis. We recover 742 mostly unknown bacterial and 1865 viral Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and leverage them to describe microbial populations under different treatment conditions. The application of multiple factors selects for prokaryotic and viral communities different from any individual factor, favouring the proliferation of potentially pathogenic mycobacteria and novel phages, which apparently play a role in shaping prokaryote communities. We also build a 25 M gene catalog to show that multiple factors select for metabolically diverse, sessile and non-biofilm-forming bacteria with a high load of antibiotic resistance genes. Finally, we show that novel genes are relevant for understanding microbial response to global change. Our study indicates that multiple factors impose selective pressures on soil prokaryotes and viruses not observed at the individual factor level, and emphasizes the need of studying the effect of concurrent global change treatments.	10.1038/s41467-025-60390-4	\N	\N	\N	Nature Communications	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60390-4	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.276	2025-07-08 18:39:38.07	\N	\N

Here employing 2bRAD-M, a novel species-resolved metagenomics approach for low-biomass microbiomes, we surveyed over 100 samples from seven frequently contacted surfaces by children, plus individual children’s palms, in two kindergartens. Microbiome compositions, although kindergarten-specific, were grouped closely based on the type of surface within each kindergarten. Extensive microbial admixture were found among the various sampled sites, likely facilitated by contact with children’s hands. Notably, bacterial species with potential human health concerns and potentially antibiotic-resistant, although found across all sampled locations, were predominantly enriched on children’s hands instead of on the environmental sites. This first species-resolved kindergarten microbiome survey underscores the importance of good hand hygiene practices in kindergartens and provides insights into better managing hygiene levels and minimizing spread of harmful microbes in susceptible indoor environments.	10.3389/fmicb.2022.871017	\N	\N	\N	Frontiers in Microbiology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.871017	\N	["GO"]	["Pt","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.268	2025-07-08 18:39:38.097	\N	\N

Methods: A prospective study was performed on 10 consecutive extubated lacrimal stents obtained for the metagenomic analysis from the patients following an endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. The stents were extubated at 4 weeks postoperatively under endoscopic guidance and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory. Following DNA extraction and library preparation, a whole shotgun metagenome sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform. The downstream processing and bioinformatics of the samples were performed using multiple software packaged in SqueezeMeta pipeline or MG-RAST pipeline. Results: The taxonomic hit distribution across the stent samples showed that bacteria were the most common isolates (mean, 69.70%), followed by viruses (mean, 0.02%) and archaea (0.003%). The 3 major phyla identified were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The prevalent organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium accolens, Dolosigranulum pigrum, Citrobacter koserii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and Hemophilus influenza. The functional subsystem profiling demonstrated microbial genes associated with metabolism, cellular, and information processing. The functional subsystem categories were metabolism involving carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA and RNA, cell wall or cell capsule biogenesis, membrane transport, virulence, and defense mechanisms. Conclusions: The present study is the first whole metagenome sequencing of the microbes isolated from the extubated lacrimal stents. The stents harbor diverse microbial communities with distinct ecosystem dynamics. Further studies on microbes-host interactions in the early postoperative period would provide valuable insights.	10.1097/iop.0000000000002202	\N	\N	2022-11-01 00:00:00	Ophthalmic Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000002202	["Pseudomonas","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","E. coli"]	["GO"]	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 08:15:04.271	2025-07-08 18:39:49.455	\N	\N

Ghangrekar"]	Performance of four microbial fuel cells (MFC-1, MFC-2, MFC-3 and MFC-4) made up of earthen pots with wall thicknesses of 3, 5, 7 and 8.5 mm, respectively, was evaluated. The MFCs were operated in fed batch mode with synthetic wastewater having sucrose as the carbon source. The power generation decreased with increase in the thickness of the earthen pot which was used to make the anode chamber. MFC-1 generated highest sustainable power density of 24.32 mW/m2 and volumetric power of 1.04 W/m3 (1.91 mA, 0.191 V) at 100 Ω external resistance. The maximum Coulombic efficiencies obtained in MFC-1, MFC-2, MFC-3 and MFC-4 were 7.7, 7.1, 6.8 and 6.1%, respectively. The oxygen mass transfer and oxygen diffusion coefficients measured for earthen plate of 3 mm thickness were 1.79 × 10−5 and 5.38 × 10−6 cm2/s, respectively, which implies that earthen plate is permeable to oxygen as other polymeric membranes. The internal resistance increased with increase in thickness of the earthen pot MFCs. The thickness of the earthen material affected the overall performance of MFCs.	10.2166/wst.2011.822	\N	\N	2011-11-30 23:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	[]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2011.822	\N	\N	["carbon","Fe"]	24320	\N	\N	crossref_api	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 14:27:20.023	2025-07-08 18:40:18.726	\N	\N

However, as this solution is not sustainable, alternative techniques are required. Chemical soil washing is one such alternative. The aim of this experimental lab-scale study is to develop a remediation and metal recovery method for Cu contaminated sites. The method is based on the washing of soil or ash (combusted soil/bark) with acidic waste liquids followed by electrolytic Cu recovery by means of bioelectrochemical systems (BES). The results demonstrate that a one- or two-step acidic leaching process followed by water washing removes &gt;80 wt. % of the Cu. Copper with 99.7–99.9 wt. % purity was recovered from the acidic leachates using BES. In all experiments, electrical power was generated during the reduction of Cu. This clearly indicates that Cu can also be recovered from dilute solutions. Additionally, the method has the potential to wash co-pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  and oxy-PAHs.</jats:p>	10.3390/met5031328	\N	\N	2015-07-22 22:00:00	Metals	\N	\N	\N	["\\"bioelectrochemical\\" AND wastewater"]	https://doi.org/10.3390/met5031328	\N	\N	["carbon","copper","Cu","Ni"]	\N	\N	BES	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:23.69	2025-07-08 23:49:26.197	\N	\N

Batch experiments were conducted to study the effect of dye and substrate concentration on MFC performance. Electricity generation was not significantly affected by the azo dye at 300 mg/L, while higher concentrations inhibited electricity generation. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and decolorization of dye containing wastewater used in the MFC were studied at optimum operation conditions in anode and cathode, 57% COD removal and 70% dye removal were achieved. This study also demonstrated the effect of different catholyte solutions, such as KMnO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cr<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>7</jats:sub> on electricity generation.

cmcuvh0r300r5fcxotxz7xj1w	Development of Bioelectrochemical Systems to Promote Sustainable Agriculture	["Xiaojin Li","Ibrahim Abu-Reesh","Zhen He"]	<jats:p>Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are a newly emerged technology for energy-efficient water and wastewater treatment. Much effort as well as significant progress has been made in advancing this technology towards practical applications treating various types of waste. However, BES application for agriculture has not been well explored. Herein, studies  of BES related to agriculture are reviewed and the potential applications of BES for promoting sustainable agriculture are discussed. BES may be applied to treat the waste/wastewater from agricultural production, minimizing contaminants, producing bioenergy, and recovering useful nutrients.

The energy generated in BES can be used as a power source for wireless sensors monitoring  the key parameters for agricultural activities.

FC/GT hybrid designs are potentially fuel flexible, dynamically responsive, scalable, low-emission generators. The current work develops a library of dynamic component models and system design tools that are used to conceptualize and evaluate hybrid cycle configurations. The physical models developed for the design analysis are capable of off-design simulation, perturbation analysis, dispatch evaluation, and control development. A parametric variation of seven fundamental design parameters provides insights into design and development requirements of FC/GT hybrids. As the primary generator in most configurations, the FC design choices dominate the system performance, but the optimal design space may be substantially different from a stand-alone FC system. FC operating voltage, fuel utilization, and balance of plant component sizing has large impacts on cost, performance, and functionality. Analysis shows that hybridization of existing fuel cell and gas turbine technology can approach 75% fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency.</jats:p>	10.1115/1.4024569	\N	\N	2013-06-16 22:00:00	Journal of Fuel Cell Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND optimization"]	https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4024569	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	\N	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:31.15	2025-07-08 18:40:13.968	\N	\N

The enzyme digests starch specifically into monomeric glucose units and as a consequence enables further glucose oxidation by microorganisms present in the MFC anode. The oxidative enzyme glucose oxidase was coupled to the glucoamylase digestive enzyme. When both enzymes were displayed on the surface of yeast cells in a mixed culture, superior fuel‐cell performance was observed in comparison with other combinations of yeast cells, unmodified yeast, or pure enzymes.

It was optimized via three upgraded versions (noted α, β and γ) in terms of design (current collectors, hydrophilic separator nature) and operating conditions (hydraulic retention time, external resistance, aeration rate, recirculation). An overall rise of power by over 100% from version α to γ shows the importance of factors such as the choice of proper construction materials and prevention of short-circuits. A power of 2.5 mW was generated with a hydraulic retention time of 2.3 h when a Selemion proton exchange membrane was used as a hydrophilic separator in the MEA and 2.8 mW were attained with a reverse osmosis membrane. The MFC also showed a competitive value of internal resistance (≈40–50 Ω) as compared to the literature, especially considering its large volume (3 L). However, the operation of our system in a complete loop where the anolyte was allowed to trickle over the cathode (version γ) resulted in system failure.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2011.067	\N	\N	2011-09-30 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND optimization"]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2011.067	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:32.202	2025-07-08 23:49:26.018	\N	\N

Sangeetha","S. Rajendra Boopathy"]	<jats:p>One of the most pressing environmental problems faced globally is waste management and landfill space. Remanufacturing is one of the green manufacturing techniques in which the geometrical form of the product is retained and the product is reused for the same purpose as during its original life cycle. This work analyzes the remanufacturability of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) which is the heart of the polymer-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). MEA was obtained by sandwiching the membrane (proton conducting membrane) between the anode and cathode of the fuel cell by hot pressing the anode and cathode onto the membrane at a desired temperature, pressure for a period of time. It is observed that 10% of MEAs are getting wasted while manufacturing it in the laboratory level. In order to utilize these waste MEAs, remanufacurability analysis is done. Wastages created in manufacturing (hot pressing) of MEA can be reduced by optimizing the manufacturing process parameters, such as temperature of the press, pressure applied, pressing time, and thickness of membrane. Using design of experiment and ANOVA contributing factors which influence the quality of MEA are identified with the help of DESIGN EXPERT software. Optimal values of process parameters are found out using desirability function in the software. The process parameter optimization will lead to reduction of wastage of MEA in hot pressing operation but these wastes cannot be avoided completely due to the presence of uncontrollable factors. So remanufacturability analysis will be useful for investigating the wastes. As a part of remanufacurability analysis design consideration for remanufacturing and recycling, the procedure for recovering the valuable materials from the retired membrane electrode assembly, reusing of electrodes are discussed. Two simulation models (current manufacturing system and manufacturing system with remanufacturing) have been created in WITNESS software in order to find the benefits of remanufacturing. The benefits are increase in MEA production and recovery of scrapped anode and cathode. Increase in MEA production due to remanufacturing has been found as 11.11%. Because of recovery process in remanufacturing, 10% of scrapped anode and cathode are utilized which leads to zero scrap of anode and cathode.</jats:p>	10.1115/1.4007418	\N	\N	2012-10-16 22:00:00	Journal of Fuel Cell Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND optimization"]	https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4007418	\N	\N	["Pt","Cu","iron","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:32.999	2025-07-08 23:49:25.956	\N	\N

Performance of a baked clayware membrane MFC inoculated with mixed anaerobic sludge pretreated with lauric acid was investigated in order to enhance power recovery by controlling methanogenesis. In the presence of lauric acid pretreated inoculum, MFC produced maximum volumetric power density of 4.8 W/m3 and the CE increased from 3.6% (for untreated inoculum) to 11.6%. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electro-kinetic evaluation indicated a higher bio-catalytic activity at the anode of the MFC inoculated with lauric acid pretreated sludge. With the lauric acid pretreated inoculum a higher catalytic current of 114 mA, exchange current density of 40.78 mA/m2 and lower charge transfer resistance of 0.00016 Ωm2 were observed during oxidation at the anode. Addition of lauric acid significantly achieved suppression of methanogenesis and enhanced the sustainable power generation of MFC by 3.9 times as compared with control MFC inoculated with sludge without any pretreatment.</jats:p>	10.2166/wst.2014.386	\N	\N	2014-09-05 22:00:00	Water Science and Technology	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2014.386	["anaerobic sludge"]	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	\N	\N	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:15.628	2025-07-08 23:49:26.419	\N	\N

cmcuvgr8a00irfcxopk6hvp2l	Power Generation from Phenol Degradation Using a Microbial Fuel Cell	["Sheng Tao Jiang","Yu Jiang Guan","Shu Li Bai"]	<jats:p>Different organics have different effects on the power generation of microbial fuel cell. A double-chamber Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) was constructed to investigate organic matter degradation and power generation. Experiments were conducted using an initial phenol concentration of 500mg/L with different glucose concentrations (500 , 250 , and 100mg/L) as the MFC fuel . Results showed that maximum voltages decreased with the decrease of concentration of glucose and the maximum voltage was 434 mV. The cycle time were 170 , 146 ,141h respectively. Correspondingly , the maximal area power densities were 10.23 mw/m2,5.02mw/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>,3.15 mw/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. phenol and COD removal rate reached 28%-33.3% and 31.1%-54.74% respectively after one cycle. However, maximum voltage was 201 mV when using 500 mg/L phenol as sole fuel. The results indicated that phenol could be used in the MFC for generating power while at the same time effectively accomplishing biodegradation. The MFC technology may provide a new method to offset operating costs, making advanced remediation measures for difficult to degrade organic materials more affordable for practical applications.</jats:p>	10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.512-515.1432	\N	\N	2012-05-13 22:00:00	Advanced Materials Research	\N	\N	\N	["\\"microbial fuel cell\\" AND power"]	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.512-515.1432	\N	\N	["Cu","Fe","Ni"]	10230	54.74	MFC	crossref_api	cmcno7mde0000o1adjp1ub0j2	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2025-07-08 18:37:13.307	2025-07-08 23:49:26.51	\N	\N
