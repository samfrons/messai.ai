# Phase 1: Foundation ✅

## Phase Overview

### Objective
Establish the core architecture, development environment, and fundamental UI components for the MESSAi platform.

### Deliverables
- ✅ Next.js 15 project setup with TypeScript
- ✅ Database schema design with Prisma
- ✅ Basic UI component library
- ✅ Initial 3D visualization framework
- ✅ Multi-branch Git architecture
- ✅ Development and deployment workflows

### Success Criteria
1. **Technical**: Development environment runs smoothly, all core dependencies installed
2. **User-Facing**: Landing page loads with basic 3D visualization
3. **Performance**: Initial page load < 3 seconds

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: 2024-12-01
- **End Date**: 2024-12-28
- **Duration**: 4 weeks

## Completed Tasks

### Week 1: Project Setup
- ✅ Task 1.1: Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- ✅ Task 1.2: Configure Tailwind CSS and design system
- ✅ Task 1.3: Set up Prisma with dual database support

### Week 2: Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Task 2.1: Design database schema for research papers and experiments
- ✅ Task 2.2: Implement multi-branch Git architecture
- ✅ Task 2.3: Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Week 3: UI Foundation
- ✅ Task 3.1: Create base UI components (buttons, forms, cards)
- ✅ Task 3.2: Implement ConditionalLayout system
- ✅ Task 3.3: Set up Three.js and React Three Fiber

### Week 4: 3D Visualization
- ✅ Task 4.1: Create basic MFC 3D model component
- ✅ Task 4.2: Implement camera controls and lighting
- ✅ Task 4.3: Add material selection interface

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Established
- Next.js App Router with TypeScript strict mode
- Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- Zustand for state management
- Three.js for 3D visualization

### Key Components Created
- `ConditionalLayout.tsx` - Responsive layout system
- `MFC3DModel.tsx` - Core 3D visualization
- `SimpleLandingPage.tsx` - Homepage interface
- Database schema with 15+ models

### Infrastructure
- 11-branch architecture for modular deployments
- Automated testing setup with Vitest
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Environment-based configuration system

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Next.js 15 App Router provides excellent performance
- Three.js integration smoother than expected
- Multi-branch architecture enables flexible deployments

### Challenges Overcome
- WebGL compatibility issues resolved with fallbacks
- Database migration strategy refined for dual-DB support
- TypeScript strict mode required careful type definitions

### Recommendations Implemented
1. Separated demo mode from production early
2. Created comprehensive documentation structure
3. Established clear branch naming conventions
