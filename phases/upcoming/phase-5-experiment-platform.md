- Bull for background job processing
- PDFKit for report generation

### Data Model
```
Experiment
â”œâ”€â”€ Protocol (versioned)
â”œâ”€â”€ Materials (linked to database)
â”œâ”€â”€ Measurements (time-series)
â”œâ”€â”€ Collaborators (with roles)
â”œâ”€â”€ Results (with analysis)
â””â”€â”€ Reports (generated)
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring experiment data accuracy â†’ Mitigation: Validation, audit trails
2. **Real-time Sync**: Handling concurrent updates â†’ Mitigation: Conflict resolution

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Storage Costs**: Large datasets â†’ Mitigation: Tiered storage strategy
2. **Compliance**: Meeting research standards â†’ Mitigation: Built-in compliance checks

## Expected Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Experiment Templates**: Pre-configured common experiments
2. **Data Collection**: Manual and automated data entry
3. **Version Control**: Track all changes to protocols
4. **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing

### Advanced Features
1. **AI Suggestions**: Recommend next steps based on results
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual measurements
3. **Integration Hub**: Connect with lab equipment
4. **Publication Ready**: Export in journal formats
