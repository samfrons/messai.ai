# Requirements Specification

## Homepage Vision & Core Features Communication

**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Complete

---

## 1. Problem Statement

MESSAI needs a compelling homepage that effectively communicates its vision of
democratizing microbial electrochemical systems research while showcasing core
platform features. The current homepage doesn't align with the established
minimalist design system and fails to create the emotional connection needed to
convert visitors into users.

## 2. Solution Overview

Create a single-page scrolling homepage that tells MESSAI's story through visual
storytelling, interactive elements, and persona-targeted messaging. The page
will feature a hero section with an interactive 3D MESS model, followed by
sections that progressively reveal the platform's value to different user types,
culminating in a clear call-to-action.
