# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should the testing scripts cover browser compatibility testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (MESSAi's 3D visualization with Three.js requires
robust cross-browser compatibility testing due to WebGL variations)

## Q2: Do you need automated visual regression testing for the 3D models and UI components?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the platform heavily relies on 3D visualizations
and complex UI interactions that need visual validation)

## Q3: Should the testing include performance testing for WebGL rendering and memory usage during 3D model interactions?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (WebGL context limits and memory leaks are critical
issues as evidenced by existing 3D renderer pool fixes)

## Q4: Do you need database integrity testing with realistic data volumes for experiments, papers, and user accounts?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the platform manages complex scientific data
relationships that need thorough testing)

## Q5: Should the testing protocols include security testing for authentication, authorization, and sensitive research data?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the platform handles user accounts, research data,
and potentially proprietary experimental results that require security
validation)
