# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Will this configuration system be integrated into the existing parameter form workflow (designs → select → configure → experiment)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the current flow already has configuration steps,
this would enhance them)

## Q2: Should the electrode/microbial configuration affect the 3D model visualization in real-time?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (visual feedback helps users understand their
configuration choices)

## Q3: Will users need to save and reuse their custom electrode/microbial configurations as presets?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (researchers often use the same configurations
across multiple experiments)

## Q4: Does this feature need to support custom/unlisted electrode materials and microbial species beyond the predefined options?

**Default if unknown:** No (the current extensive list covers most research
needs)

## Q5: Should configuration changes immediately update the AI power predictions and performance metrics?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (real-time feedback is already a pattern in the
existing UI)
