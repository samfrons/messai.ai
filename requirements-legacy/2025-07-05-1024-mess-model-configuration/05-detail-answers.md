# Expert Detail Question Answers

## Q6: Should custom electrode materials require users to input all scientific properties (conductivity S/cm, electron transfer rate, biocompatibility rating) or just basic cost/efficiency estimates?

**Answer:** No **Implications:** Custom materials will have a simplified form
with name, cost, and efficiency percentage. Advanced properties will be
auto-estimated based on efficiency.

## Q7: Will configuration presets be private to each user by default, with an option to share publicly in a community library?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Need to implement privacy controls,
public/private toggle, and a community preset browsing interface.

## Q8: Should the 3D model show different visual materials (textures/colors) for each electrode type, or just highlight the selected component with the material name?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** MESSModel3D needs material mapping to Three.js
materials with distinct visual properties for each electrode type. Will leverage
the existing material library system.

## Q9: Do custom microbial species need to specify electron transfer mechanisms (direct transfer, mediated, etc.) for accurate power predictions?

**Answer:** No **Implications:** Custom microbes will use a simplified
efficiency factor (0-100%) rather than complex biochemical parameters.

## Q10: Should invalid material combinations (e.g., incompatible electrode/microbe pairs) show warnings but still allow configuration, rather than blocking the selection?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Implement a compatibility matrix with
educational warnings but no hard restrictions. Warnings should explain why
certain combinations are suboptimal.

## Additional Context: MESS Parameters JSON Integration

The user highlighted the comprehensive `mess-parameters-json.json` file which
contains:

- 500+ parameters across 18 major categories
- Detailed microbial system parameters including biofilm properties, metabolic
  rates, and species characteristics
- Extensive electrode material properties with scientific units and ranges
- This should be integrated to provide more sophisticated configuration options
  and validation
