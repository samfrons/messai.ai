# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-05 10:24 **Request:** configuring mess model electrodes,
microbial communities, and design

## Context

The user wants to implement functionality for configuring MESS (Microbial
Electrochemical Systems) models, specifically:

- Electrode configuration
- Microbial community selection/configuration
- Design parameters

This appears to be related to the 3D MFC (Microbial Fuel Cell) models we've been
working with, extending them to allow users to configure various aspects of the
electrochemical system.
