# Expert Detail Questions

## Q6: Should custom electrode materials require users to input all scientific properties (conductivity S/cm, electron transfer rate, biocompatibility rating) or just basic cost/efficiency estimates?

**Default if unknown:** No (just basic properties - most users won't have
detailed scientific measurements)

## Q7: Will configuration presets be private to each user by default, with an option to share publicly in a community library?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows the pattern of experiments being private by
default with sharing options)

## Q8: Should the 3D model show different visual materials (textures/colors) for each electrode type, or just highlight the selected component with the material name?

**Default if unknown:** No (just highlight with name - full material rendering
would be complex and might impact performance)

## Q9: Do custom microbial species need to specify electron transfer mechanisms (direct transfer, mediated, etc.) for accurate power predictions?

**Default if unknown:** No (can use a simplified "efficiency factor" instead of
complex biochemical parameters)

## Q10: Should invalid material combinations (e.g., incompatible electrode/microbe pairs) show warnings but still allow configuration, rather than blocking the selection?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (warnings educate users but don't restrict research
experimentation)
