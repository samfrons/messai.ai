# Context Findings

## Current Database Architecture

### Database Technology Stack

- **Current Development**: SQLite (`file:./prisma/dev.db`)
- **Production Target**: PostgreSQL on Vercel
- **ORM**: Prisma Client v5.22.0
- **Connection**: Pooled connections through Prisma

### Current Database Schema Analysis

Based on `prisma/schema.prisma`, the platform includes:

- **User Management**: User, Account, Session models
- **Authentication**: NextAuth integration with Google OAuth
- **Research Data**: UserProfile, UserSettings, UserPreferences
- **Scientific Data**: VerificationToken, PasswordReset models
- **Experiment Data**: Based on schema, stores user research configurations

### Current Database Files

```
prisma/
├── dev.db (192KB SQLite - current development)
├── schema.prisma (15KB - main schema)
├── schema.sqlite.prisma (6KB - SQLite version)
└── seed.ts (2KB - seeding script)
```

### Existing Infrastructure

- **Development Environment**: Local SQLite with Prisma Studio
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel with Postgres
- **Migration System**: Currently using `prisma db push` (no formal migrations
  yet)
- **Seeding**: Basic seed script available

## Current Backup Status

### Development Backup Status

- ❌ **No automated backups** for local SQLite
- ❌ **No migration files** - using schema push only
- ❌ **No backup scripts** in package.json
- ❌ **No data loss prevention** mechanisms

### Production Readiness Analysis

According to `docs/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`:

- Production deployment planned for Vercel with PostgreSQL
- Environment variables configured for production database
- No backup strategy documented in deployment guide
- Migration strategy mentions `prisma migrate dev --name init` but not
  implemented

## Research Platform Data Criticality

### Critical Data Types Identified

1. **User Research Profiles**: Institution, research areas, preferences
2. **Experiment Configurations**: System parameters, electrode materials
3. **Scientific Results**: AI predictions, performance data
4. **Authentication Data**: User accounts, sessions, verification tokens
5. **Research Literature**: Based on literature database requirements found

### Data Loss Impact Assessment

- **User Research Data**: Irreplaceable - months of experiment configurations
- **Scientific Results**: Irreplaceable - computed predictions and analysis
- **User Accounts**: High impact - institutional research accounts
- **System Configurations**: Recoverable but time-consuming to recreate

## Technology-Specific Backup Considerations

### Vercel PostgreSQL Backup Capabilities

From web search findings:

- **Manual Backups**: Using `pg_dump` with custom format
- **Restore Process**: Using `pg_restore` to target database
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Requires WAL archiving setup
- **Version Compatibility**: Must match PostgreSQL versions

### Prisma ORM Considerations

- **Migration Safety**: Need proper migration files vs. schema push
- **Connection Pooling**: Affects backup performance
- **Schema Evolution**: Critical for maintaining data integrity during updates

## Best Practices Research Findings

### PostgreSQL Backup Best Practices (2025)

1. **WAL Archiving**: Essential for point-in-time recovery
2. **Regular Schedule**: Automated daily/hourly backups
3. **Security**: Encrypted backups with access controls
4. **Testing**: Regular restore testing validation
5. **Monitoring**: Backup success/failure alerting

### Research Platform Specific Requirements

- **Compliance**: Research data often has regulatory requirements
- **Retention**: Long-term storage for scientific reproducibility
- **Integrity**: Checksums and validation for scientific data
- **Documentation**: Backup/restore procedures for operations team

## Current Gaps Analysis

### Critical Missing Components

1. **No backup automation** for any environment
2. **No migration strategy** implemented
3. **No point-in-time recovery** capability
4. **No backup monitoring** or alerting
5. **No disaster recovery plan** documented
6. **No data integrity checks** during migrations

### Migration Safety Gaps

- Using `prisma db push` instead of proper migrations
- No rollback procedures documented
- No pre-migration backup automation
- No migration testing environment

### Operational Gaps

- No backup/restore documentation for operators
- No emergency procedures for data loss
- No backup storage security measures
- No compliance considerations addressed

## Related Features Found

Based on requirements analysis in the codebase:

- **Literature Database**: Large scientific paper database requiring backup
- **User Authentication**: Critical user account data
- **Research Data**: Experiment configurations and results
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Needs backup of test data and scenarios

## Files Requiring Modification

### Core Infrastructure

- `lib/db.ts` - Database connection and configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Schema migration strategy
- `package.json` - Backup/restore scripts

### New Files Needed

- `scripts/backup/` - Backup automation scripts
- `scripts/restore/` - Restore procedures
- `docs/BACKUP_PROCEDURES.md` - Operations documentation
- `prisma/migrations/` - Proper migration files

### Configuration Updates

- Environment variables for backup storage
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Implementation Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Vercel serverless environment limitations
- PostgreSQL version compatibility requirements
- Prisma ORM migration capabilities
- Connection pooling during backup operations

### Operational Constraints

- Research platform uptime requirements
- Data retention policy requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- Recovery time objectives for critical data

## Next Phase Focus Areas

The detail questions should focus on:

1. **Backup frequency and retention policies**
2. **Emergency recovery time requirements**
3. **Security and compliance requirements**
4. **Migration rollback procedures**
5. **Monitoring and alerting preferences**
