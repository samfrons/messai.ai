# Detail Questions

**Phase 4: Expert Requirements Questions**

Based on deep codebase analysis, here are the 5 most pressing detailed questions
to clarify system behavior:

## Q1: Should the grants database include application deadline notifications and reminders?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the existing email system in lib/email.ts supports
notifications, and deadline management is critical for researchers)

## Q2: Should grant applications support document attachments and file uploads?

**Default if unknown:** No (keeping the initial implementation simple, documents
can be referenced via URLs initially)

## Q3: Should the grants database support category-based filtering similar to the literature systemType field?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (following the ResearchPaper pattern which uses
systemType for classification and filtering)

## Q4: Should users be able to export their grant applications and search results to CSV/Excel?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (data export is standard functionality for research
management tools)

## Q5: Should the system track application success rates and statistics for grants?

**Default if unknown:** No (this adds complexity and may not be essential for
the initial MVP implementation)
