# Initial Request: Paper-Specific 3D Models

## User Request

"but it should be a model based on the specifications of the paper. let's start
with the nickel paper so the 3d model accurately looks like the model in the
paper"

## Context

The user wants to move beyond generic 3D models to create accurate,
paper-specific 3D visualizations that match the actual systems described in
research papers. The focus is on starting with the nickel silicide nanowire
paper to create a scientifically accurate 3D model.

## Background

- Current implementation shows generic 3D models that don't reflect paper
  specifications
- Two in silico papers are available: nickel silicide nanowire MFC and
  Shewanella flow cell MFC
- Users can currently click from paper results to the 3D lab, but get generic
  models
- Need to create models that accurately represent the specific systems described
  in the research

## Goal

Create a 3D model that accurately represents the nickel silicide nanowire MFC
system with:

- Correct dimensions and geometry
- Nanowire electrode structure visualization
- Material properties representation
- Performance metrics overlay
- Scientific accuracy for research validation

## Target Paper

**Nickel silicide nanowire anodes for microbial fuel cells**

- Model Type: `nanowire-mfc`
- System: Microfluidic chip with nanowire electrodes
- Key Features: 850 nanowires/mm², 2.5μm length, 50nm diameter
- Performance: 323 mW/m² power density
