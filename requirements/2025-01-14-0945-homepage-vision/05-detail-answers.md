## Q6: Should the homepage hero section include a live 3D preview of a MESS model that users can interact with?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** We'll need to implement a lightweight,
optimized 3D model viewer in the hero section using Three.js/React Three Fiber.
This should be a simplified version of the lab viewer, focusing on visual impact
while maintaining performance.

## Q7: Will the statistics section need to pull real-time data from the database or can we use static numbers that are manually updated?

**Answer:** No **Implications:** We'll use static numbers that can be updated
during deployments. This keeps the homepage fast and reduces database load on
the public-facing page.

## Q8: Should each persona section (researchers, students, engineers) have its own dedicated full-width section with specific benefits and CTAs?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** We'll create three distinct full-width
sections, each tailored to a specific persona with relevant benefits, use cases,
and calls-to-action that resonate with their needs.

## Q9: Will the homepage need to include testimonials or research paper highlights to build credibility?

**Answer:** Not yet **Implications:** We'll skip testimonials and research
highlights for now. This can be added in a future iteration once we have
collected user feedback and success stories.

## Q10: Should the final CTA section offer multiple pathways (free trial, demo request, documentation) or focus on a single primary action?

**Answer:** No **Implications:** We'll focus on a single primary "Get Started"
CTA to maximize conversion, with a secondary text link to documentation for
those who want to learn more before signing up.
