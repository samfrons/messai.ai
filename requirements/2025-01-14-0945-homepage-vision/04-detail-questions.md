## Q6: Should the homepage hero section include a live 3D preview of a MESS model that users can interact with?

**Default if unknown:** No (keep the homepage lightweight and fast-loading, save
complex 3D for the Laboratory page)

## Q7: Will the statistics section need to pull real-time data from the database or can we use static numbers that are manually updated?

**Default if unknown:** No (use static numbers initially to avoid database
queries on the public homepage, can be updated during deployments)

## Q8: Should each persona section (researchers, students, engineers) have its own dedicated full-width section with specific benefits and CTAs?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (clear separation helps each audience quickly find
relevant information and increases conversion)

## Q9: Will the homepage need to include testimonials or research paper highlights to build credibility?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (social proof through research outcomes and user
testimonials significantly increases trust in scientific platforms)

## Q10: Should the final CTA section offer multiple pathways (free trial, demo request, documentation) or focus on a single primary action?

**Default if unknown:** No (focus on single primary action - "Get Started" - to
maximize conversion rate, with secondary link to documentation)
