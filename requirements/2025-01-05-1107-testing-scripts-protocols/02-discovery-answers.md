# Discovery Answers

## Q1: Should the testing scripts cover browser compatibility testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Need to set up cross-browser testing
infrastructure with tools like Playwright or Selenium for WebGL compatibility
validation across different browser engines.

## Q2: Do you need automated visual regression testing for the 3D models and UI components?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Implement visual testing tools like Percy,
Chromatic, or custom screenshot comparison for 3D models, LCARS UI components,
and responsive layouts.

## Q3: Should the testing include performance testing for WebGL rendering and memory usage during 3D model interactions?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Create performance benchmarks for WebGL
context management, memory leak detection, frame rate monitoring, and 3D model
loading times.

## Q4: Do you need database integrity testing with realistic data volumes for experiments, papers, and user accounts?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Develop database seeding scripts with
realistic volumes, test data relationships, migration validation, and
backup/restore procedures.

## Q5: Should the testing protocols include security testing for authentication, authorization, and sensitive research data?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Implement security test suites for NextAuth
integration, API endpoint protection, data validation, XSS prevention, and CSRF
protection.
