# Expert Detail Answers

## Q6: Should the testing scripts include Playwright integration for cross-browser WebGL compatibility testing of the Three.js 3D models?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Implement Playwright with browser-specific
configurations for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Include WebGL-specific
launch arguments like `--use-angle=angle` for consistent GPU acceleration. Set
up visual regression testing for 3D model rendering consistency.

## Q7: Do you need comprehensive authentication security testing including JWT token validation, session management, and rate limiting for the NextAuth implementation?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Create dedicated `/tests/auth/` directory with
comprehensive test suites for NextAuth integration, JWT validation, session
security, password security, and API endpoint protection. Include rate limiting
and CSRF protection testing.

## Q8: Should the testing protocols include database integrity testing with realistic experiment data volumes and Prisma relationship validation?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Develop `/tests/database/` testing
infrastructure with Prisma-specific test utilities, realistic data seeding,
relationship validation, migration testing, and transaction integrity
verification for scientific data workflows.

## Q9: Do you want automated performance regression testing for WebGL memory usage and 3D model rendering frame rates to prevent the context limit issues?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Implement performance monitoring for WebGL
context management, memory leak detection, frame rate benchmarking, and 3D model
loading performance. Create automated alerts for performance regressions that
could cause WebGL context exhaustion.

## Q10: Should the testing include security vulnerability scanning for file uploads in the literature system and API endpoint protection?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** Integrate security testing tools like OWASP
ZAP, implement file upload security validation (type checking, malware scanning,
size limits), and comprehensive API security testing including input validation,
SQL injection prevention, and XSS protection.
