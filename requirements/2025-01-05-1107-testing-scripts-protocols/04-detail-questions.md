# Expert Detail Questions

## Q6: Should the testing scripts include Playwright integration for cross-browser WebGL compatibility testing of the Three.js 3D models?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on existing WebGL context issues and the need
for consistent 3D rendering across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge with
different GPU drivers)

## Q7: Do you need comprehensive authentication security testing including JWT token validation, session management, and rate limiting for the NextAuth implementation?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the platform handles user accounts and research
data, but currently lacks any authentication testing in `/tests/auth/`
directory)

## Q8: Should the testing protocols include database integrity testing with realistic experiment data volumes and Prisma relationship validation?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the platform stores complex scientific data
relationships between users, experiments, papers, and measurements that need
validation)

## Q9: Do you want automated performance regression testing for WebGL memory usage and 3D model rendering frame rates to prevent the context limit issues?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (existing codebase shows WebGL context pool fixes
indicating memory management is critical for platform stability)

## Q10: Should the testing include security vulnerability scanning for file uploads in the literature system and API endpoint protection?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the `/app/literature/upload/page.tsx` handles file
uploads and API endpoints lack comprehensive security testing)
