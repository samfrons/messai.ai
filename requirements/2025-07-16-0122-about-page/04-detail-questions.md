# Detailed Requirements Questions

These technical questions will clarify specific implementation details now that
we understand the codebase structure.

## Q6: Should team member data be stored as a TypeScript constant in the component file following the pattern used in mockData.ts files?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent with how research mock data is currently
handled in the codebase)

## Q7: Will the timeline component need to support horizontal scrolling on mobile devices like the existing responsive patterns?

**Default if unknown:** No (vertical timeline is more mobile-friendly and
follows existing mobile-first patterns)

## Q8: Should the About page use the same scroll-triggered animation pattern with IntersectionObserver as the home page components?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains consistency with existing animation
patterns throughout the site)

## Q9: Will team photos be stored in /public/images/team/ directory following Next.js static asset conventions?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (standard Next.js practice for optimized image
serving)

## Q10: Should the About page follow the alternating white/gray-50 background pattern for sections like the home page?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains visual consistency with the established
design system)
