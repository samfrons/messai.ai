# Discovery Questions - Create Account and Login

Based on the initial analysis of the MESSAi codebase, I can see there's already
a comprehensive authentication system in place using NextAuth.js with support
for credentials and Google OAuth. The system includes user registration, login,
email verification, password reset, and role-based access control.

Here are the five most important yes/no questions to understand the
requirements:

## Q1: Should we keep the existing authentication implementation and just ensure it's working properly?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the existing implementation appears complete and
follows best practices)

## Q2: Do you need any additional authentication providers beyond email/password and Google OAuth?

**Default if unknown:** No (these two methods cover most use cases)

## Q3: Should email verification be mandatory for new account creation?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (improves security and ensures valid email
addresses)

## Q4: Do you want to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security?

**Default if unknown:** No (the schema supports it but it's not implemented yet,
can be added later)

## Q5: Should the system maintain the current role-based access control (USER, RESEARCHER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides good granularity for permissions)
