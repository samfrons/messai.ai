# Expert Detail Questions - Create Account and Login

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the critical implementation
questions:

## Q6: Should the email verification link expire after 24 hours (standard practice)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (balances security with user convenience)

## Q7: When users reset their password, should we automatically log them in or require them to login with the new password?

**Default if unknown:** No (require login for security - ensures the user
remembers their new password)

## Q8: Should unverified users be able to login but see a restricted dashboard prompting email verification?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (better UX than blocking login entirely, follows the
pattern in auth-options.ts line 168)

## Q9: Should we send a notification email when a password is successfully reset for security awareness?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (alerts users to potential unauthorized access
attempts)

## Q10: Should the middleware automatically redirect unauthenticated users to /auth/login when accessing protected routes like /dashboard and /experiment?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (standard pattern for protected routes, better than
showing error pages)
