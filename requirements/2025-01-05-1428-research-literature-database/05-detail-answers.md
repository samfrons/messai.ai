## Q7: Should the paper search functionality use PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities when deployed to production?

**Answer:** Yes

- Will use PostgreSQL full-text search
- Better performance for large datasets
- Supports ranking and relevance
- Includes stemming and advanced features

## Q8: Should we implement a dedicated /app/literature route following the same pattern as /app/designs and /app/experiments?
