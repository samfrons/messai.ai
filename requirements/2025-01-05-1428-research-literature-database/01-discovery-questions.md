# Discovery Questions - Research Literature Database

These questions will help us understand the scope and requirements for the
research literature searchable database feature.

## Q1: Will users need to upload and manage their own research papers in addition to searching existing literature?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (most research platforms benefit from
user-contributed content)

## Q2: Should the literature database integrate with external academic databases (e.g., PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (researchers expect access to established literature
sources)

## Q3: Will the system need to store full-text PDFs of research papers locally?

**Default if unknown:** No (copyright concerns and storage costs make linking
preferable)

## Q4: Should the literature search results be integrated with the existing experiment tracking features?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (connecting experiments to relevant research adds
significant value)

## Q5: Will this feature require real-time updates of new publications in the field?

**Default if unknown:** No (periodic updates are typically sufficient for
research purposes)
