# Expert Requirements Questions - Research Literature Database

These detailed questions address specific implementation decisions now that we
understand the codebase architecture.

## Q6: Should we extend the existing User model with a papers[] relation for uploaded papers, maintaining the same ownership pattern as experiments?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistent with the User → Experiments pattern in
prisma/schema.prisma)

## Q7: Should the paper search functionality use PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities when deployed to production?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (better performance than simple LIKE queries for
large datasets)

## Q8: Should we implement a dedicated /app/literature route following the same pattern as /app/designs and /app/experiments?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains consistency with existing navigation
structure)

## Q9: Should external API integrations (PubMed, CrossRef) cache results in our database to reduce API calls and improve performance?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows best practices and reduces dependency on
external services)

## Q10: Should paper metadata include specialized fields for microbial electrochemical systems (e.g., organism type, electrode materials, power output)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (domain-specific metadata would enhance search
relevance for MESSAi users)
