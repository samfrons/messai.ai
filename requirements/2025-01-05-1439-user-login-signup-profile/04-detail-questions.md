# Expert Requirements Questions

## Q1: Should we replace the UserMenu component in app/layout.tsx to fix the missing profile view issue?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the layout currently shows "Guest User" instead of
integrating the existing UserMenu component)

## Q2: Do you want to maintain the existing Tailwind CSS approach when removing LCARS theming from auth components?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (keeps consistency with the existing design system
and avoids major architectural changes)

## Q3: Should we extend the current UserProfile table to support research collaboration features rather than create new tables?

**Default if unknown:** No (separation of concerns suggests dedicated tables for
UserConnection, ResearchProject, etc.)

## Q4: Do you want admin features to use the existing role-based access control (USER/RESEARCHER/ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN) system?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (leverages existing infrastructure and maintains
security model)

## Q5: Should the enhanced profile features integrate with the existing ResearchPaper table for publication tracking?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (reuses existing literature database and maintains
data consistency)
