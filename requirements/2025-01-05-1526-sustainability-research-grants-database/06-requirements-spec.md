# Requirements Specification: Sustainability Research Grants Database

**Project:** MESSAi MVP  
**Feature:** Sustainability Research Grants Database  
**Date:** 2025-01-05  
**Version:** 1.0

## Problem Statement

Researchers working on microbial electrochemical systems and sustainability
projects need a centralized, searchable database of funding opportunities to
support their research. Currently, researchers must manually search multiple
funding organization websites, track application deadlines, and manage their
grant applications across different platforms.

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive grants database within the MESSAi platform that
provides:

- Searchable catalog of sustainability research grants
- Application tracking and deadline management
- Integration with the existing research literature database
- Export capabilities for research management

## Implementation Hints

### Database Models

```typescript
// Grant model based on ResearchPaper patterns
model Grant {
  id                      String   @id @default(cuid())
  title                   String
  organization            String
  description             String?
  amount                  Float?
  currency                String   @default("USD")
  applicationDeadline     DateTime?
  category                String   // JSON array: ["Energy", "Environment", etc.]
  eligibilityRequirements String?
  applicationUrl          String
  contactEmail            String?
  isActive                Boolean  @default(true)
  createdBy               String
  createdAt               DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt               DateTime @updatedAt

  user                    User     @relation(fields: [createdBy], references: [id])
  applications            GrantApplication[]
  papers                  GrantPaper[]
}

model GrantApplication {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  grantId   String
  userId    String
  status    String   @default("SAVED") // SAVED, DRAFT, SUBMITTED, UNDER_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED
  notes     String?
  appliedAt DateTime?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  grant     Grant    @relation(fields: [grantId], references: [id])
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

### Key File Modifications

1. **Navigation**: Add grants section to `app/layout.tsx` sidebar (between
   Literature and User section)
2. **Database**: Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with new models
3. **API Routes**:
   - `app/api/grants/route.ts` (CRUD operations)
   - `app/api/grants/[id]/route.ts` (individual grant)
   - `app/api/grant-applications/route.ts` (application tracking)
   - `app/api/grants/export/route.ts` (CSV export)
4. **Pages**:
   - `app/grants/page.tsx` (main listing)
   - `app/grants/[id]/page.tsx` (grant details)
   - `app/grants/admin/page.tsx` (admin management)
   - `app/grants/applications/page.tsx` (user applications)
5. **Components**: Create `components/grants/` directory with GrantCard,
   GrantFilters, ApplicationTracker, etc.

### Route Structure (see 07-routing-structure.md for details)

- **Public**: `/grants`, `/grants/[id]`, `/grants/applications`
- **Admin**: `/grants/admin`, `/grants/admin/create`, `/grants/admin/[id]/edit`
- **API**: `/api/grants/*`, `/api/grant-applications/*`

### Reusable Patterns

- **Search Implementation**: Copy from `app/api/papers/route.ts` advanced search
  patterns
- **Card Components**: Create GrantCard using standard Tailwind classes
  (following literature patterns)
- **Form Patterns**: Use `app/literature/upload/page.tsx` patterns for grant
  creation
- **Pagination**: Reuse pagination components from literature feature
- **UI Components**: Use clean, modern Tailwind styling without LCARS theme

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Users can search and filter grants effectively
- [ ] Users can track their grant applications
- [ ] Email notifications work for approaching deadlines
- [ ] Data export produces accurate CSV files
- [ ] Grants integrate with research literature

### User Experience

- [ ] Interface follows clean, modern design with standard Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Search results load within 2 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsive design functions properly
- [ ] Navigation between grants and literature is intuitive
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

### Technical Standards

- [ ] All API endpoints include proper authentication
- [ ] Database queries are optimized with appropriate indexes

- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Data Quality

- [ ] Grant information displays accurately
- [ ] Application status tracking works reliably
- [ ] Deadline calculations are correct
- [ ] Export data matches displayed information
- [ ] Historical grants remain accessible

## Assumptions

1. **Data Source**: Administrators will manually enter grant information (no
   automated data feeds)
2. **User Authentication**: All users must be authenticated to access grants
   database
3. **Email Delivery**: Existing email system (`lib/email.ts`) is reliable for
   notifications
4. **Storage**: Database can handle expected volume of grants and applications
5. **Performance**: Current hosting infrastructure supports additional database
   load
6. **Maintenance**: Administrators will keep grant information current and
   accurate

## Dependencies

- **Authentication System**: Requires existing NextAuth.js implementation
- **Email System**: Depends on configured email service in `lib/email.ts`
- **Database**: Requires Prisma ORM and database connection
- **UI Components**: Uses standard Tailwind CSS for clean, modern styling
- **Literature Feature**: Leverages existing patterns from research papers
  feature

## Success Metrics

- Users can find relevant grants within 3 search attempts
- Application tracking reduces missed deadlines by 80%
- Email notifications have 95% delivery success rate
- Data export generates accurate files for 100% of requests
- Feature adoption by 70% of active researchers within 30 days
