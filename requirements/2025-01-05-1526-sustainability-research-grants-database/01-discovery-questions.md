**Phase 2: Context Discovery Questions**

Based on the codebase analysis, here are the five most important yes/no
questions to understand the problem space:

## Q1: Will users be able to add their own grants to the database?

**Default if unknown:** No (most grant databases are curated by administrators
to ensure quality and accuracy)

## Q2: Should the grants database integrate with the existing research papers feature?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (grants often fund research that results in
publications, creating valuable connections)

## Q3: Will users need to track their grant applications within the platform?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (application tracking adds significant value for
researchers managing multiple opportunities)

## Q4: Should the database include expired/closed grants for historical reference?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (historical data helps researchers understand
funding patterns and plan future applications)

## Q5: Will this feature require different permission levels for viewing grants?

**Default if unknown:** No (most grant information is public knowledge, making
open access more valuable for researchers)
