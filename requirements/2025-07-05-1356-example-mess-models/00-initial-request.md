# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-05 **Requester:** User **Project:** MESSAi Platform

## Request Summary

Now let's do requirements for the example mess models. There should be a
lab-on-chip type microbial fuel cell of microscope slide dimensions, a benchtop
bioreactor connected to a fuel cell stack, a algal building facade panel, like a
solar panel, a modular wastewater treatment system, a benthic microbial fuel
cell.

## Context

The user is requesting the development of 5 new example MESS (Microbial
Electrochemical Systems) models to be added to the MESSAi platform. These models
represent different scales and applications of bioelectrochemical systems:

1. **Lab-on-chip MFC** - Microscope slide dimensions for microscale research
2. **Benchtop bioreactor + fuel cell stack** - Laboratory-scale system
   integration
3. **Algal building facade panel** - Solar panel-like architectural integration
4. **Modular wastewater treatment system** - Environmental/municipal application
5. **Benthic microbial fuel cell** - Marine/aquatic sediment application

## Initial Scope

- Design and implement 5 new bioelectrochemical system models
- Integration with existing 3D visualization system (Three.js)
- Scientific parameter integration for each model type
- AI prediction capabilities for each system
- User interface components for model selection and configuration
- Documentation and examples for each model type

## Platform Context

MESSAi is a sophisticated bioelectrochemical systems research platform with:

- Interactive 3D visualization using Three.js
- AI-powered predictions for system optimization
- Comprehensive experiment tracking
- Scientific material database with 27 electrode options
- LCARS-themed UI
- Existing model examples including mason jar, earthen pot designs

The new models should integrate seamlessly with the existing platform
architecture and scientific accuracy standards.
