# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should we enhance the existing models in app/designs/page.tsx rather than creating entirely new ones?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (4 of the 5 requested models already exist:
lab-on-chip micro MFC, benchtop bioreactor, algal facade panel, wastewater
treatment, and benthic MFC)

## Q2: Should the new/enhanced models integrate with the existing 3D visualization system in components/DesignSpecific3DModels.tsx?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintain consistency with existing 3D model
rendering architecture)

## Q3: Will these models need specific scientific parameters and AI prediction capabilities for their unique applications?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (each model type has distinct operating parameters,
substrates, and performance characteristics)

## Q4: Should we create dedicated 3D models for each system type with accurate visual representations?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (visual differentiation helps users understand
design differences and applications)

## Q5: Will users need guided workflows for each model type's specific experimental setup and monitoring?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (different models require specialized knowledge for
optimal operation and data interpretation)
