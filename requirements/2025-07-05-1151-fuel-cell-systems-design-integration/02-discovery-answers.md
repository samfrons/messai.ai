algorithm simulation and testing + Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing
capabilities **Rationale**: Comprehensive control system suite will make MESSAi
a complete system-level design platform for fuel cell control systems.

### 4. User Interface Integration

**Selected**: B) Unified design interface supporting both microbial and fuel
cell systems **Rationale**: Seamless integration between system types using the
new basic Tailwind CSS styling (phasing out LCARS theme).

### 5. Performance Analysis

**Selected**: E) All of the above **Rationale**: Complete performance analysis
capabilities including static calculations, dynamic simulation, optimization
algorithms, and comparative analysis with microbial systems.

### 6. Technical Implementation

**Selected**: E) Hybrid approach combining multiple methods **Rationale**:
Flexibility to use the best solution for each aspect of fuel cell modeling
within MESSAi's TypeScript/Three.js architecture.

### 7. 3D Visualization

**Selected**: C) Unified 3D environment supporting both system types
**Rationale**: Seamless visualization across all electrochemical system types
within MESSAi's existing Three.js framework.

### 8. Data Management

**Selected**: C) Unified database schema supporting multiple system types
**Rationale**: Enable seamless data management and cross-system analysis within
MESSAi's Prisma ORM structure.

### 9. Target Users
