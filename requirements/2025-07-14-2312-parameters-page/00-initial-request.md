# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-14 23:12 **Request:** a parameters page

## Context

The user has requested the development of a parameters page for the MESSAI.AI
platform, which is a microbial electrochemical systems AI platform focused on
research, laboratory simulation, and predictions.

## Current State

The platform currently has:

- Research page: AI-enhanced paper search and analysis
- Laboratory page: 3D modeling and visualization
- Predictions page: AI predictions engine
- Dashboard: Main landing page

## Initial Understanding

A parameters page would likely be related to the MESS (Microbial Electrochemical
Systems) parameters mentioned in the CLAUDE.md file, which describes a
comprehensive parameter library with 150 categories including custom materials,
electrode properties, and microbial species.
