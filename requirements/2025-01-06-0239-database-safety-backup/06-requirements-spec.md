# Database Safety and Backup Protocols - Requirements Specification

## Problem Statement

The MESSAi research platform currently lacks comprehensive database safety
measures and backup protocols, creating significant risk for irreplaceable
research data. The platform handles critical scientific data including
experiment configurations, research results, and user research profiles that
would be extremely difficult or impossible to recreate if lost.

**Current State:**

- Development using SQLite with no automated backups
- Production deployment planned on Vercel PostgreSQL without backup strategy
- Using `prisma db push` instead of proper migrations
- No disaster recovery procedures
- No data integrity validation during schema changes

**Target State:**

- Comprehensive automated backup system with point-in-time recovery
- Safe migration procedures with rollback capabilities
- Monitoring and alerting for backup health
- Documented disaster recovery procedures
- Regular backup restoration testing

## Solution Overview

Implement a multi-layered database safety system consisting of:

1. **Automated Backup Infrastructure**: Daily backups with 30-day retention
2. **Migration Safety System**: Proper Prisma migrations with pre-migration
   backups
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Real-time backup health monitoring
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Documented and tested disaster recovery processes
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Backup restoration testing in deployment pipeline

  Vercel Blob)
- **TR2.2**: Versioned backup files with timestamp naming
- **TR2.3**: Compressed backup format to optimize storage

- **TR3.3**: Logging and audit trail for all backup operations
- **TR3.4**: Error handling and retry logic for failed operations
- **TR3.5**: Health checks for backup system components

### TR4: Migration System

- **TR4.1**: Prisma migration files in `prisma/migrations/` directory
- **TR4.2**: Migration deployment through `prisma migrate deploy`
- **TR4.3**: Shadow database for migration validation
- **TR4.4**: Rollback scripts for each migration
- **TR4.5**: Migration state tracking and validation

## Implementation Hints and Patterns

### Database Connection (`lib/db.ts`)

```typescript
// Add backup configuration
export const backupConfig = {
  schedule: process.env.BACKUP_SCHEDULE || '0 2 * * *', // Daily at 2 AM
  retention: parseInt(process.env.BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS || '30'),
  storage: process.env.BACKUP_STORAGE_URL,
};
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:backup": "node scripts/backup/create-backup.js",
    "db:restore": "node scripts/backup/restore-backup.js",
    "db:backup-test": "node scripts/backup/test-restoration.js",
    "db:migrate": "prisma migrate deploy",
    "db:migrate-dev": "prisma migrate dev"
  }
}
```

### Backup Script Structure (`scripts/backup/`)

- `create-backup.js` - Manual and automated backup creation
- `restore-backup.js` - Database restoration procedures
- `test-restoration.js` - Backup integrity testing
- `monitor-backups.js` - Health monitoring and alerting
- `cleanup-old-backups.js` - Retention policy enforcement

### Migration Workflow

1. Create migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name feature-name`
2. Pre-deployment backup: Automatic before `prisma migrate deploy`
3. Deploy migration: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. Post-migration validation: Data integrity checks
5. Rollback if needed: Restore from pre-migration backup

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Backup Configuration
BACKUP_STORAGE_URL="s3://messai-backups"
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * *"
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS="30"
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key"

# Monitoring
BACKUP_ALERT_EMAIL="hi@messai.io"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="optional-slack-webhook"
```
