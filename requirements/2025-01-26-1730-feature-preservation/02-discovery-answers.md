## Q1: Should this feature protection system prevent modifications to existing API endpoints and routes?

**Answer:** Yes **Rationale:** API changes can break frontend functionality and
integrations

## Q2: Do you want automated testing to run before every major code change to catch regressions?

**Answer:** Yes **Rationale:** Automated regression testing is industry best
practice

## Q3: Should the system track and validate that all existing 3D models and visualizations continue to work?

**Answer:** Yes **Rationale:** Database changes can cause irreversible data loss

## Summary

All questions answered affirmatively, indicating a comprehensive feature
preservation system is needed covering:

- API endpoint protection
- Automated regression testing
- 3D functionality validation
- Rollback mechanisms
- Database schema monitoring
