# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Will users primarily be creating custom modifications to existing MESSAi tools rather than building entirely new features?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (platform already has robust tools - users likely
want to customize rather than rebuild)

## Q2: Should the onboarding system integrate with the existing wizard at app/onboarding/page.tsx?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (leverage existing onboarding infrastructure and
user flow)

## Q3: Do users need to gather requirements for scientific/research-specific modifications?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (MESSAi is a scientific platform targeting
researchers and institutions)

## Q4: Will users need guided templates for common modification types (new electrode materials, custom experiments, etc.)?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (scientific users benefit from structured approaches
to complex modifications)

## Q5: Should the system support collaborative requirement gathering for research teams?

**Default if unknown:** No (start with individual user onboarding, add
collaboration later)
