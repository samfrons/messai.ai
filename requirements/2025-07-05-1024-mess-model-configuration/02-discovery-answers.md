# Discovery Question Answers

## Q1: Will this configuration system be integrated into the existing parameter form workflow (designs → select → configure → experiment)?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** We'll enhance the existing ParameterForm
component and workflow rather than creating a separate configuration system.

## Q2: Should the electrode/microbial configuration affect the 3D model visualization in real-time?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** The MESSModel3D component will need to accept
configuration props and update materials/colors based on electrode and microbial
selections.

## Q3: Will users need to save and reuse their custom electrode/microbial configurations as presets?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** We'll need to implement preset management with
CRUD operations, likely stored in localStorage initially or in the database for
registered users.

## Q4: Does this feature need to support custom/unlisted electrode materials and microbial species beyond the predefined options?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** We'll need to add "Custom" options in
dropdowns with additional input fields for properties like conductivity, cost,
efficiency for materials, and growth rate, electron transfer rate for microbes.

## Q5: Should configuration changes immediately update the AI power predictions and performance metrics?

**Answer:** Yes **Implications:** The prediction calculations will need to be
reactive, updating whenever any configuration parameter changes, using the
existing AI prediction infrastructure.
