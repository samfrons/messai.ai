# Biofilm Conductivity

## Definition

Biofilm Conductivity refers to the electrical conductance of microbial biofilms
formed on electrode surfaces within Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESS).
These living films consist of communities of bacteria and extracellthyrial
polymers that facilitate electron transfer between cells, thus contributing
significantly to the overall current generation in MESS.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 1e-7 - 5 S/m (varies with species composition)
- **Typical**: Approximately 2-3 S/m for common electroactive bacteria like
  Geobacter sulfur Ferrophilus.
- **Optimal**: Between 4 and 6 S/m, where high conductivity is often associated
  with efficient electron transfer rates conducive to superior system
  performance in bioelectricity generation or wastewater treatment applications.

## Measurement Methods

Biofilm Conductivity can be measured using electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) which evaluates the frequency response of a biological film
and its associated electron transfer resistance, often represented as
charge-transfer resistance in equivalent electrical circuits. Alternatively,
four-point probe measurements may also provide conductivity values by applying
an AC current through outer electrodes while measuring voltage drops across
inner ones placed within or adjacent to the biofilm layer.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microbial Composition**: Different microorganisms have varying intrinsic
   electrical properties, which can significantly affect conductivity levels in
   a given MESS system.
2. **Biofilm Thickness and Porosity**: The structural characteristics of the
   biofilm directly impact its ability to facilitate electron flow; thicker or
   denser films may impede current generation compared with more porous
   structures that allow for better ionic movement within conductive matrices
   like extracellular polymers.
3. **Nutrient Availability**: Essential nutrients and electrolytes in the growth
   medium can influence biofilm formation, density, metabolism rates of
   microbes, which subsequently affects their electron transfer capabilities to
   or from anode surfaces within MESS systems.
4. **Environmental Conditions (Temperature & pH)**: Optimal environmental
   conditions are crucial for maintaining high conductivity; extremes in
   temperature and incorrect pH levels can disrupt biofilm integrity, leading to
   decreased electrical performance due to reduced microbial activity or altered
   extracellular matrix properties.

## Performance Impact

Higher Biofilm Conductivity is typically correlated with enhanced system
efficiency as it facilitates more effective electron transfer from the
biological component (biofilms) of MESS systems, leading directly to increased
current generation and energy recovery or treatment efficacy in applications
such as microbial fuel cells. Low conductivities can indicate suboptimal biofilm
formation which may result in poor system performance due to limited
electrochemical interaction between bacteria and the anode surface.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable Biofilm Conductivity should fall within a range that is consistent
with known optimal ranges for specific microbial species used, typically around
4-6 S/m in well-performing systems: [min] >0 (nonzero conductance) and max <15
S/m to avoid excessively high values which may indicate nonbiological
conduction.
