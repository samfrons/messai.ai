# Voltage Output

## Definition

Voltage output is the electrical potential difference between the anode and
cathode in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS). It represents the driving
force for electron flow and is determined by the thermodynamic potentials of the
redox reactions occurring at each electrode, minus various overpotentials and
ohmic losses. Voltage output is a critical parameter for determining system
power output and electrical efficiency.

**Formula:** V_cell = E_cathode - E_anode - η_losses

Where:

- V_cell = Cell voltage (V)
- E_cathode = Cathode potential (V)
- E_anode = Anode potential (V)
- η_losses = Overpotentials and ohmic losses (V)
