# Substrate Affinity

## Definition

Substrate Affinity in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS) refers to the
ability of a substrate, typically an organic compound used as fuel by certain
bacteria or enzymes within bioelectrochemical devices, to bind and be
metabolized at the biocathode. This parameter is crucial for assessing how
effectively microorganisms can convert chemical energy into electrical power in
MESS applications.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0] - [15] L/g/h (Liters of substrate per gram of biocathode
  material consumed hourly)
- **Typical**: 3 to 7 L/g/h for common microbial consortia used in MESS.
- **Optimal**: [5] - [10] L/g/h, where higher values indicate a more efficient
  substrate utilization and electron transfer rate leading to better system
  performance.

## Measurement Methods

Substrate affinity is typically measured by monitoring the consumption rates of
known quantities of specific organic compounds in controlled biocathode
experiments over time using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or
similar analytical techniques that quantify substrate concentration.
Electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry coupled with microbial
activity assays, can also be used to assess the kinetics of electron transfer
from metabolizing cells directly at electrodes in situ within MESS devices.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microorganism Species and Consortia**: Different bacteria have varying
   enzymatic capabilities for substrate uptake, which affects their affinity
   levels; engineered consortia can be optimized to enhance overall performance.
2. **Substrate Concentration Gradients**: Higher gradients generally increase
   the rate of diffusion and thus microbial consumption rates up until a
   saturating point is reached where additional substrates do not further
   accelerate metabolism (mass-action kinetics).
3. **Electrode Surface Properties**: The surface chemistry, roughness, porosity,
   or functionalization of the electrodes can enhance microbial adhesion and
   biofilm formation which in turn affects substrate affinity through increased
   local concentrations near biocathodes (Nernstian behavior).
4. **Environmental Conditions**: Temperature, pH levels, ionic strength, as well
   as the presence of other competing microbial species can influence metabolism
   and thus affect how effectively substrates are utilized by target organisms
   in MESS systems.

## Performance Impact

Higher Substrate Affinity typically correlates with increased current densities
due to more efficient conversion rates from chemical energy into electrical
power, enhancing the overall output of a microbial electrochemical system (MES).
However, this must be balanced against substrate limitations and potential
inhibitory effects at high concentrations.

## Validation Rules

- Acceptable Substrate Affinity range for optimal performance: 5 - 10 L/g/h;
  lower values may indicate suboptimal microbial activity, while higher ones
  could suggest nonlinear kinetics or substrate inhibition effects at high
  concentrations.
- Validation involves comparing measured rates of consumption against known
  standards and ensuring reproducibility across multiple trials with identical
  conditions for the biocathode material under study.
