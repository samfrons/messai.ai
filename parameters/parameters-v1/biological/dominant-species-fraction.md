# Dominant Species Fraction

## Definition

The Dominant Species Fraction parameter in microbial electrochemical systems
(MESS) quantifies the proportion of a single dominant species within the mixed
culture that is actively involved in electron transfer processes at the bioanode
or biocathode, which are critical for system efficiency. This fraction reflects
how much bacterial population directly contributes to electricity generation and
electrochemical reactions taking place on the microbial fuel cells' surfaces.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0%] - [100%], as it is not possible for a species fraction to
  exceed 100%.
- **Typical**: Between 25% and 75%, where the exact value can vary widely
  depending on system design, operational conditions, and microbial community
  structure.
- **Optimal**: A higher dominant species fraction within this range of around
  [40%] to [60%], as it often correlates with optimal electron transfer rates
  without overloading a single metabolic pathway or risking system instability
  due to monoculture dominance, which can be detrified by competitive
  inhibition.

## Measurement Methods

This parameter is typically measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for specific
microbial markers indicative of the dominant species coupled with flow cytometry
or fluorescent tagging to estimate cell counts and proportions within a mixed
culture, providing an approximation that can be correlated back into actual
fractions.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Nutrient Availability**: Sufficient nutrients are required for the growth
   of electrogenic bacteria; imbalance may favor non-electroactive species,
   altering this fraction.
2. **Electrical Potential Gradient**: The voltage applied across an MESS can
   selectively inhibit or promote certain microbial populations based on their
   metabolism and electron transfer capabilities.
3. **Temperature & pH Levels**: Optimal ranges for these environmental factors
   are crucial as they influence the growth rate of different species,
   potentially affecting dominance within a culture.
4. **Inoculum Composition**: The initial microbial community composition can set
   up an imbalanced system where one or few types may become dominant due to
   competitive advantages in electron transfer efficiency and resilience against
   environmental stressors.

## Performance Impact

The Dominant Species Fraction has a direct impact on the current density, power
output, and overall stability of MESS systems; higher fractions typically lead
to increased electrical generation if these species are efficient electrogenic
organisms. However, an overly high fraction may result in decreased system
resilience due to lack of metabolic diversity which can compromise operation
under variable conditions or when faced with pathogen attacks and environmental
stresses that select for non-electroactive microbes.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges should be within the typical values, where:

- **Minimum** acceptable range is 0% (indicating no dominant species), which may
  signal system failure or ineffective operation if expected performance metrics
  are not met under this condition.
- The maximum value of [100%] indicates a monoculture that might be less
  resilient but could provide consistent output, provided the single organism is
  highly electrogenic and stable over time without succumbing to stress or
  inhibitory effects from competitors' metabolites.
