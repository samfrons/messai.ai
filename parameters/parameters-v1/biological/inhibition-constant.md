# Inhibition Constant

## Definition

The Inhibition Constant (K_i) is a critical parameter in microbial
electrochemical systems that quantifies substrate inhibition—a phenomenon where
an excess of nutrient or feedstock leads to decreased metabolic activity and
reduced efficiency of the bioelectrochemical process. It represents the
concentration at which further addition of the substrate begins to hinder
microbial growth rather than stimulate it, thereby affecting electron transfer
rates in MESS systems negatively.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0] - [5] g/L (Note that these values can vary significantly
  depending on specific organisms and system configurations.)
- **Typical**: 1-3 g/L for common microbial consortia in MESS.
- **Optimal**: Below the threshold of substrate saturation, typically less than
  or equal to K_i; optimal performance is often observed at concentrations
  ranging from [0] - [2] g/L where electron transfer rates are maximized without
  significant negative feedback due to inhibition.

## Measurement Methods

The Inhibition Constant can be determined experimentally by conducting batch
culture tests with varying substrate concentrations and monitoring the system'
extrinsic parameters, such as current output or voltage potential (in a
controlled electrochemical cell). The point at which further increases in
concentration lead to decreased performance indicates K_i. Alternatively,
mathematical models that describe microbial growth kinetics can be fitted with
experimental data using software like MATLAB® and the Inhibition Constant
extracted as part of parameter estimation for optimal substrate feeding
strategies.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microorganism Characteristics**: Different species or strains have varying
   tolerances to high concentrations, directly influencing K_i values.
2. **Nutrient Composition and Complexity**: The presence of multiple substrates
   can result in competitive interactions that alter the effective concentration
   at which inhibition occurs for each component.
3. **Operational Conditions (Temperature & pH)**: These environmental factors
   affect microbial metabolism, potentially raising or lowering K_i values due
   to changes in enzyme kinetics and cell membrane permeability.
4. **Electrode Materials/Configuration**: The interaction between the electrodes
   used within MESS systems can modify substrate availability at sites of
   electron transfer influencing microbial uptake rates, thus affecting K_i
   measurements indirectly through system design choices.

## Performance Impact

High Inhibition Constant values suggest that excessive feedstock concentrations
will not only fail to enhance but rather impede the electrochemical performance
due to substrate inhibition—leading potentially to lower current densities,
reduced power output and decreased coulombic efficiency. It is crucial for
system designers to maintain nutrient levels below this threshold while ensuring
sufficient microbial growth rates are sustained throughout operation cycles.

## Validation Rules

- **Acceptable Range**: K_i values should be determined experimentally and fall
  within the typical range provided, with a margin of error that accounts for
  system variability (±0.5 g/L from measured value).
- Any reported or calculated Inhibition Constant outside this empirical window
  may indicate an experimental setup issue rather than true substrate inhibitory
  effects on microbial activity and should be revalidated through additional
  testing if necessary.
