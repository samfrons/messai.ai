# Chlorella Vulgaris

## Definition

In microbial electrochemical systems (MESS), "Chlorella vulgaris" refers to a
species of green microalga that is often utilized as an inoculum or biocathode
material due to its photosynthetic activity and ability to fix carbon dioxide.
The presence and health of Chlorella vulgaris within the system are critical for
optimizing bioelectrochemical processes, where it contributes directly to
electricity generation through microbial electrosynthesis or indirectly by
enhancing CO2 sequestration in photofermenters integrated with electrodes.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 1x10^6 - 5x10^8 cells/mL (typically)
- **Typical**: Between 3x10^7 and 4x10^8 cells/mL, which is considered a healthy
  population density for effective bioelectrochemical activity.
- **Optimal**: The optimal range can vary based on the specific MESS design but
  generally falls between 4x10^7 to 5x10^8 cells/mL where maximum photosynthetic
  efficiency and electron transfer rates are observed, leading to enhanced
  system performance.

## Measurement Methods

Chlorella vulgaris cell density is typically measured using optical microscopy
or flow cytometry for precise enumeration within the culture medium of MESS
systems. Spectrophotometric methods can also be employed by assessing
chlorophyll concentration as an indirect measure, which correlates with biomass
and healthy algal growth levels in cultures.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Light Intensity**: Optimal light conditions are required for
   photosynthesis; too much or little can stress the cells leading to reduced
   activity within MESS systems.
2. **Nutrient Availability (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus)**: Essential nutrients
   must be in balance as they directly impact algal growth and metabolism which
   affects their electrochemical contribution.
3. **CO₂ Concentration**: The availability of CO₂ for photosynthesis is
   critical; fluctuations can lead to variable performance due to changes in
   biomass production rates within the MESS system.
4. **Temperature and pH Levels**: These environmental factors must be maintained
   at levels conducive to Chlorella vulgaris growth, as extreme deviations could
   impair cellular functions affecting overall bioelectrochemical performance.

## Performance Impact

The healthy population density of Chlorella vulgaris is directly linked with the
efficiency in which CO₂ can be fixed and converted into biomass or electricity
within MESS systems, making it a key parameter for system productivity. High
cell densities typically correlate to higher rates of photosynthesis leading to
increased bioelectrical output when integrated properly as part of an electrode
surface coating (biofilm).

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges should be established based on empirical data from similar
systems, with a focus on maintaining the health and sustainability within MESS.
For example:

- **Minimum**: 3x10^7 cells/mL to ensure sufficient population for effective CO2
  fixation; below this range may indicate suboptimal conditions or system
  failure in supporting algal growth.
- **Maximum Capacity (Saturation)**: Not typically defined as excessive cell
  densities can lead to light attenuation and oxygen overproduction, which might
  disrupt the electrochemical processes within MESS systems; however, this
  varies based on system design specifics.
