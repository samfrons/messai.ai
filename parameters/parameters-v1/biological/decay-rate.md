# Decay Rate

## Definition

The "Decay Rate" parameter in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS)
quantifies the rate at extrinsic decay of organic substrates by indigenous or
engineered biofilms on anodes within a biocathode setup, typically expressed as
inverse hours per hour (1/h).

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0.5] - [2.5] 1/h
- **Typical Range for Performance Monitoring**: Approximately between these
  values under controlled conditions within the system, where optimal
  performance is often observed at midpoints of this range (around ~1.5 to 2.0
  1/h).
- **Optimal Values for System Efficiency Enhancement**: Typically varies
  depending on microbial strain and substrate but may peak around [1.8] - [2.3]
  1/h when the system is well balanced with biofilm growth rates aligning
  closely to electron transfer capabilities of electrodes without overgrowth or
  inhibition effects.

## Measurement Methods

The decay rate can be measured using respirometry techniques, where oxygen
consumption (or CO2 production) linked directly correlates with the substrate
degradation activity within a closed system setup; this is often coupled to
electrochemical measurements for real-time monitoring. Calibration against known
standards or in vitro biofilm growth assays can provide additional accuracy and
contextual understanding of decay rates under specific operational conditions.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microbial Community Composition**: Different microbes have varying
   metabolic capabilities, influencing the rate at which they degrade substrates
   on electrode surfaces.
2. **Substrate Concentrulation and Type**: The nature (simpler sugars vs complex
   polymers) and concentration of organics available for degradation can
   significantly impact decay rates due to differences in bioavailability and
   microbial uptake kinetics.
3. **Electrode Materials & Surface Properties**: Biofilm adhesion, growth rate
   modulation, and electron transfer efficiency are affected by the electrodes'
   surface chemistry which can either enhance or impede decay rates depending on
   their properties (e.g., conductivity).
4. **System Operating Conditions**: Parameters such as pH, temperature,
   hydraulic retention time, and nutrient supply directly influence microbial
   activity levels affecting the overall degradation rate within MESS systems.
5. [Additional Factor - Optional] Electrode Surface Area to Volume Ratio (not
   always considered but can be significant): Higher surface areas generally
   provide more sites for biofilm formation, potentially increasing decay rates
   up until a threshold where overgrowth or inhibition may occur due to
   competition and resource limitation.

## Performance Impact

The Decay Rate is critical as it determines the rate at which organic substrates
are converted into electrical energy within MESS systems; higher degradation
efficiency can lead directly to increased power output, while suboptimal decay
rates may result in lower system performance and reduced bioelectricity
generation. It also influences CO2 production or oxygen consumption as
byproducts of the biodegradation process which must be managed for
sustainability purposes within closed systems (e.g., sealed microbial fuel
cells).

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges should align with typical values observed under controlled
conditions, where deviations may indicate system imbalances or measurement
errors:

- **Minimum Acceptable Range**: [0.5] - 1/h (to ensure sufficient substrate
  degradation without overgrowth).
- **Maximum Threshold for Optimal Performance Monitoring**: Not to exceed the
  upper range of typical values, generally around ~2.3 1/h before risk of
  inhibition or decreased efficiency begins; however this may vary with specific
  system design and operational parameters set by researchers (e.g., [0] -
  [2.5]).
- **Validation Criteria**: Consistency across multiple measurements, calibration
  against known standards for respirometry equipment used in monitoring decay
  rates to ensure accuracy of readings; cross-referencing with electrochemical
  data when possible can provide a comprehensive understanding and validation
  approach.
