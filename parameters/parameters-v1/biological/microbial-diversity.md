# Microbial Diversity Index

## Definition

The Microbial Diversity Index (ID: microbial_diversity) in microbial
electrochemical systems quantifies the biodiversity within an electrical
biofilm, typically using a metric such as Shannon'dictive diversity index which
accounts for both species richness and evenness. This parameter is crucial to
understanding how diverse populations of microbes contribute to various
processes like substrate degradation or electron transfer in MESS systems.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0, 5] (unitless) - The actual range may vary depending on the
  specific system and conditions; however, this is a common scale for diversity
  indices where higher values indicate greater biodiversity within microbial
  communities in electrochemical environments.
- **Typical**: Between 1 to 3 indicates moderate species richness with some even
  distribution among them under typical operational parameters of MESS systems.
- **Optimal**: Values between 2 and 4 are often associated with optimal
  performance, as a balanced microbial community can efficiently conduct
  electrochemical reactions necessary for system functioning without being
  overly susceptible to perturbations or inhibitory effects from specific
  dominant species.

## Measurement Methods

The Microbial Diversity Index is commonly measured using molecular techniques,
such as:

- DNA sequencing of microbial community samples followed by bioinformatics
  analysis with software like QIIME2 to calculate Shannon diversity based on the
  relative abundance and distribution of different species.
- Phenotypic assays that estimate metabolic activity can indirectly suggest
  biodiversity, though they do not provide a direct measurement as molecular
  methods would.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Nutrient Availability**: The presence and concentration of nutrients in the
   system directly influence microbial growth rates which affect diversity
   indices by promoting or suppressing certain species over others.
2. **Electrode Materials & Surface Properties**: These can selectively enhance
   specific electrogenic organisms, thereby altering community composition and
   resulting biodiversity measurements within the system.
3. **Operational Conditions (Temperature/pH)**: Extreme or fluctuating
   operational conditions may reduce diversity by selecting for extremophiles
   while excluding others from thriving in such environments, thus impacting
   microbial community structure and biodiversity indices within MESS systems.
4. **Inoculum Source Diversity**: The initial seed of the biofilm can set a
   baseline that determines which species are present at higher levels as they
   establish themselves over time; this influences overall diversity
   measurements from early stages onwards in system development and operation
   phases.

## Performance Impact

The Microbial Diversity Index has significant implications for MESS performance:

- Higher biodiversity can enhance resilience to environmental fluctuations,
  potentially leading to more stable electrochemical outputs over time due to a
  wider range of metabolic capabilities within the microbial community.
- A diverse biofilm may improve substrate degradation efficiency and electron
  transfer rates as different species might specialize in various aspects or
  stages of these processes; however, if not properly balanced, it could also
  lead to competition that impairs system performance.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges for the Microbial Diversity Index should be consistent with
established benchmarks from literature and empirical observations within similar
systems:

- **Minimum Acceptance**: 0 (indicating a lack of detectable microbial
  diversity) to as high as practically achievable under controlled conditions,
  often around or above the typical range.
- The system should be validated against known standards for biodiversity
  indices with acceptable ranges typically being within one standard deviation
  from mean values reported in similar studies (e.g., 1 - 3). Outliers may
  indicate measurement errors or significant deviations that require
  investigation, such as contamination issues or sensor malfunctioning.
