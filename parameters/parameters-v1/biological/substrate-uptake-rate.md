# Substrate Uptake Rate

## Definition

The Substrate Uptake Rate (substrate_uptake_rate) in microbial electrochemical
systems quantifies the rate at extruded substrates into biomass per gram of
existing biofilm mass, typically measured on an hourly basis. This parameter is
critical for assessing how efficiently a microorganism converts organic matter
to electricity within MESS devices.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0 - 1 g/g/h (varies with species and conditions)
- **Typical**: Between 0.25 - 0.75 g/g/h for common electrogenic bacteria under
  optimal lab settings
- **Optimal**: Approximately between 0.6 to 1.0 g/g/h, which correlates with
  peak bioelectricity production efficiency in MESS systems without substrate
  limitation or oxygen deprivation issues.

## Measurement Methods

This parameter is commonly measured by monitoring the concentration of organic
matter (substrate) entering and leaving a bioreactor over time using techniques
such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The uptake rate can also
be estimated through mathematical modeling based on substrate consumption,
biofilm growth rates observed via microscopy or other imaging methods.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Substrate Concentr0ation**: Higher concentrations may lead to increased but
   not necessarily linear uptake due to saturation effects and inhibitory
   by-products at high levels.
2. **Biofilm Thickness/Surface Area Available for Attachment**: The physical
   structure of the biofilm can limit substrate access, affecting overall rates
   differently depending on density or morphology changes over time due to
   growth dynamics.
3. **Microbial Community Composition and Activity Levels**: Different microbes
   have varying metabolic capabilities; thus their community composition will
   influence uptake efficiency based upon the predominant species present in a
   given system at any moment, as well as how active they are under specific
   conditions (e.g., temperature).
4. **Oxygen Availability**: Obligate and facultative anaerobes may have
   different substrate uptake rates depending on the presence of oxygen; some
   microbes might even experience inhibition or stimulation by varying levels
   due to their metabolic pathways being affected differently.
5. **pH Levels**: The acidity/alkalinity can alter enzyme activities and
   membrane transport mechanisms, thereby influencing the substrate uptake rate
   within a MESS system; optimal pH ranges for microbial activity must be
   maintained to ensure efficient conversion of organic matter into electric
   current.
6. **Temperature**: Microorganism metabolic rates are temperature-dependent and
   can significantly affect their ability to process the substrate, with each
   species having an optimum range where uptake is maximized without denaturing
   enzymes or compromising membrane integrity.
7. **Nutrient Availability (other than Substrate)**: The presence of essential
   nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus can impact microbial growth rates,
   which in turn affects substrate uptake as a faster-growing biofilm may
   consume the available organic matter more quickly.
8. **Shear Stress (in flow systems)**: In continuous or trickle bed bioreactors
   where fluid dynamics are important for nutrient delivery and waste removal,
   shear forces can impact microbial attachment which affects substrate uptake
   rates due to potential detachment of cells from the biofilm.
9. **Presence/Absence of Inhibitory Compounds**: Accumulation or introduction
   into system may reduce metabolic activity and thus lowered rate, while
   certain compounds might stimulate specific microbial pathways leading to
   increased uptake under controlled conditions (e.g., using inducible
   promoters).
10. **System Age/Maturity**: Over time biofilms can become more structured or
    stratified; this maturation may lead to gradients of substrate concentration
    and oxygen, affecting the overall uptake rates across different layers
    within a system's bioreactor surface area.
11. **Hydrodynamic Conditions**: In systems where mixing is important (e.g.,
    with periodic stirring or aeration), hydraulic conditions can influence
    substrate delivery and distribution, which in turn affect uptake rates due
    to potential mass transfer limitations within the biofilm matrix.

## Performance Impact

The Substrate Uptake Rate directly influences system performance by dictating
how quickly organic matter is converted into electricity; higher efficiency
usually correlates with increased power output and better overall energy
recovery from waste streams or renewable resources used as substrates in MESS
systems. Optimizing this parameter can lead to enhanced bioelectric generation,
making the technology more commercially viable for applications such as
bioremediation combined electrical production (powering sensors within a
remediation site).

## Validation Rules

- **Acceptance Criteria**: The measured rate should fall between 0.25 - 1 g/g/h,
  with the optimal range being approximately from 0.6 to 1.0 for peak
  performance without substrate limitation or oxygen deprivation issues; rates
  outside this window may indicate suboptimal conditions that require adjustment
  (either by changing operational parameters like flow rate and aeration).
- **Calibration Standards**: Instruments used in measurement should be
  calibrated regularly, with traceable standards to ensure accuracy. HPLC
  measurements must follow standardized protocols for quantification of
  substrate concentrations before uptake calculations are made; mathematical
  models require validation against empirical data and cross-referencing
  established benchmark studies within the field when applicable.
