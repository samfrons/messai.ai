# Mediator Concentration

## Definition

The Mediator Concentration parameter in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS)
refers to the concentration of electron mediators, which are small molecules or
metal complexes that facilitate electron transfer between the biological
component and an electrode surface within a bioelectrochemical system. These
mediators shuttle electrons from the active sites on microbial cells directly to
the conductive material at the interface where electricity is generated.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0.1] - [50] mM (typically measured in laboratory settings)
- **Typical**: 2-10 mM, which often balances between sufficient electron
  transfer and avoiding toxicity or substrate saturation effects on microbial
  activity.
- **Optimal**: The optimal range for performance varies depending upon the
  specific MESS design but is generally within [5] - [30] mM where maximum
  current generation without inhibiting biological processes occurs, typically
  around 10 to 20 mM based on literature findings.

## Measurement Methods

The concentration of electron mediators can be measured using spectrophotometric
methods by monitoring the absorbance at specific wavelengths corresponding to
the absorption peak of a known standard or through electrochemical techniques
like cyclic voltammetry, which provides insights into redox behavior and
concentrations.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microbial Species**: Different microbes have varying natural electron
   transfer capabilities that can affect mediator requirements.
2. **Electrode Materials & Surface Properties**: The conductivity, surface area,
   and biocompatibility of electrodes influence the required concentration for
   effective mediation.
3. **Mediator Type/Complexity**: Simple organic molecules like methylene blue
   may require different concentrations compared to more complex synthetic
   mediators or biocathodes with multiple active sites.
4. **Operational Conditions (Temperature, pH)**: The environmental conditions
   can alter the efficiency of electron transfer and thus affect optimal
   concentration levels for effective operation.
5. **Microbial Population Dynamics & Health**: Microbe viability impacts
   mediator uptake; overgrowth or decline may necessitate adjustments in
   concentrations to maintain system balance.

## Performance Impact

The Mediator Concentr0ation directly influences the rate of electron transfer,
which affects current generation and power output within MESS systems.
Insufficient concentration can lead to bottlenecks at electrode interfaces
resulting in lower efficiency or complete cessation of electricity production;
excessive concentrations may be wasteful economically while potentially
disrupting microbial health leading again to reduced performance, known as
mediator poisoning effect where the electron transfer is hindered due to
overaccumulation.

## Validation Rules

- **Acceptable Range**: Must fall within established optimal ranges for specific
  MESS configurations; typically between 5 and 30 mM but can vary based on
  system design (e.g., [min] = 2, max = 40) with a focus around the midpoint of
  this range to prevent extremes that could harm microbial activity or electrode
  functioning.
- **Validation Criteria**: Consistency in current generation over time and
  across multiple measurements; absence of significant fluctuations indicating
  stable mediator concentration within operational parameters must be observed
  for system validation purposes.
