# Microbial Growth Rate

## Definition

The Microbial Growth Rate parameter in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS)
quantifies the rate at extruding new biomass of microorganisms per hour, which
is critical for maintaining efficient bioelectricity generation and substrate
conversion. It reflects how quickly a culture grows under specific conditions
within an MESS reactor or chamber where both electrochemical processes occur
alongside metabolic activities driven by the presence of conductive materials
like graphite-based cathodes, which are colonized by microbes such as Shewanella
oneidensis MR-1.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.05 - 2 h⁻¹ (varies with species and environmental conditions)
- **Typical**: Approximately between 0.7 to 1.3 h⁻¹ for optimized systems under
  controlled laboratory settings
- **Optimal**: Typically, a growth rate of around 1.5 - 2.0 h⁻¹ is associated
  with peak performance in MESS applications due to balanced metabolic activity
  and biofilm formation on electrodes without overgrowth that could lead to
  clogging or reduced electron transfer efficiency

## Measurement Methods

The Microbial Growth Rate can be measured using optical density (OD) at 600 nm
through spectrophotometry, which correlates with biomass concentration.
Alternatively, dry weight measurements after centrifugation provide a direct
assessment of microorganism mass accumulation over time in the culture medium.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Nutrient Availability**: Sufficient carbon and nitrogen sources are
   essential for growth; imbalances can slow down or halt metabolic processes,
   affecting electron transfer rates to electrodes.
2. **Temperature Control**: Most microbes have an optimal temperature range
   (usually 30°C - 45°C); deviations outside this scope may reduce the growth
   rate and system efficiency due to enzyme denaturation or reduced metabolic
   activity at lower temperatures, while higher than ideal heat can lead to
   suboptimal microbial performance.
3. **pH Levels**: Microbes often thrive within a narrow pH range; significant
   deviations from the optimal value (typically around neutral for many MESS
   systems) could inhibit growth and metabolic activity, reducing electron
   transfer rates necessary to sustain electrochemical reactions effectively.
4. **Oxygen Concentration**: Aerobes require oxygen while anaerobes are
   sensitive; the balance must be maintained as excessive or insufficient levels
   can impede microbial growth and metabolism, impacting system performance
   negatively due to altered electron transfer dynamics between
   biofilm-electrode interface.

## Performance Impact

The Microbial Growth Rate is directly proportional to the rate of substrate
conversion into electricity; a higher optimal range indicates efficient microbe
activity and robust electrochemical generation, leading to better system
performance in terms of energy output per unit time or mass processed by
biofilms. Conversely, suboptimal growth rates can lead to decreased power
production due to less active biomass for electron transfer processes at the
anode surface within MESS systems.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges are species-specific but generally fall between 0.5 - 2 h⁻¹;
however, validation should consider system specifics and desired performance
outcomes:

1. **Minimum Acceptable Range** (for basic functionality): At least a quarter of
   the optimal range to ensure survival without significant power generation
   impairment due to slow growth rates or ineffective biofilm formation on
   electrodes; typically, this would be around 0.375 - 0.6 h⁻¹ for many systems
2. **Optimal Range**: Roughly between the typical and maximum values where
   microbial activity is robust yet controlled to prevent overgrowth or clogging
   issues that could impede electron transfer; this range should be monitored
   closely, often around 1 - 1.5 h⁻¹
3. **Maximum Acceptable Range**: Should not exceed the upper limit of typical
   values by more than a small margin (e.g., no higher than approximately 20%
   above) to prevent system inhibition due to overpopulation; this could be
   roughly upwards from about 1 h⁻¹
4. **Validation Criteria**: Regular monitoring through OD measurements or dry
   weight assessments, with immediate corrective actions for deviations outside
   these ranges (either adjusting environmental conditions like nutrient flow
   rates and temperature controls) or re-optimizing the system design to
   accommodate different microbial strains better.
