# Inoculum Concentration

## Definition

The "Inoculum Concentration" parameter refers to the initial density of
microbial cells introduced into a Microbial Electrochemical System (MESS). This
concentration is critical as it sets up the biological foundation for subsequent
electrogenic activity, wherein these organisms convert substrates directly onto
an electrical current.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0 - 1 x 10^8] cells/mL (varies depending on system design)
- **Typical**: Approximately [5 x 10^6 to 3 x 10^7] cells/mL for standard lab
  setups.
- **Optimal**: Varies by microbial strain; however, a common optimal range is
  around [8 x 10^6 - 2 x 10^7] cells/mL to balance growth and system efficiency
  without overloading the biocathode surface area available for biofilm
  formation.

## Measurement Methods

Inoculum concentration can be measured using a spectrophotometer by assessing
optical density at specific wavelength, which correlates with cell count per
milliliter of culture medium when calibrated against known standards or through
direct microscopic counting methods such as flow cytometry.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Nutrient Availability**: Sufficient nutrients are necessary to support the
   growth and metabolism required for electricity generation without leading to
   excessive biomass that could overcrowd electrode surfaces or result in
   substrate limitation due to high cell density competition.
2. **Temperature Control**: Optimal temperature ranges must be maintained
   (typically between 30°C and 45°C) for the specific microbial strain used, as
   deviations can affect growth rates significantly impacting concentration
   levels.
3. **pH Levels**: The pH of culture medium should remain within a range
   tolerable by the chosen organism (typically between neutral to slightly
   acidic), which is essential since extreme pH values could inhibit microbial
   activity or kill cells, altering their population density and system
   performance.
4. **Oxygen Supply**: Adequate aeration must be ensured for obligately anaerobic
   organisms while preventing excessive oxygen that may lead to oxidative stress
   in facultatively microorganisms; both extremes can affect cell viability and
   concentration levels within the system.

## Performance Impact

The initial Inoculum Concentration directly influences how quickly a
steady-state biofilm forms on electrodes, which is essential for efficient
electron transfer to generate current in MESS systems. An optimal range ensures
sufficient microbial activity without overcrowding or substrate depletion that
would impede system performance and longevity of the biocathode surface area due
to excessive biofilm thickness leading to diffusion limitations within cells,
which can reduce electron transfer rates significantly.

## Validation Rules

- The Inoculum Concentration must be confirmed using a calibrated
  spectrophotometer or flow cytometry with an acceptable range of [5 x 10^6 - 2
  x 10^8] cells/mL, depending on the specific microbial strain used.
- The concentration should not exceed system capacity; typically no more than a
  doubling from initial inoculation is recommended to prevent substrate
  limitation and maintain electrode surface area for biofilm growth (e.g.,
  starting with 1 x 10^7 cells/mL, the maximum would be around 2 x 10^8
  cells/mL).
- The concentration must fall within a range that ensures microbial health
  without causing oxygen limitation or substrate depletion; this requires
  periodic monitoring and adjustments.
