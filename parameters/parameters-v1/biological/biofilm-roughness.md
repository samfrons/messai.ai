# Biofilm Roughness

## Definition

Biofilm roughness in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS) refers to the
uneven surface texture of a biofilm, which is an aggregation of microorganisms
adhered to an interface between two phases or materials with distinct
properties—typically solid and liquid. This parameter quantifies the
topographical irregularities on the biocathode' extraneous surfaces where
electrogenic bacteria reside within MESS devices.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0.1] - [50] μm (varies with biofilm development stage and
  environmental conditions)
- **Typical**: Between 2 to 30 μm, depending on the growth phase of microbial
  communities within MESS systems.
- **Optimal for Performance**: Roughness values between 5 to 15 μm are often
  associated with enhanced electron transfer rates and biofilm conductivity due
  to increased surface area contact points without causing excessive mass
  transport limitations or detachment risks of the microbial layer from
  electrode surfaces.

## Measurement Methods

Biofilm roughness is commonly measured using profilometry, which includes
techniques like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and white light
interferometry for non-invasive surface topography analysis at high resolution
in the microscale range relevant to MESS applications. Additionally, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) can provide detailed imagery of biofilm morphology
when combined with image processing algorithms that estimate roughness
parameters from visual data sets.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Biofilm Growth Phase**: Biofilms typically exhibit different textures
   during initial adhesion, maturation and detachment phases—each stage
   influencing the overall surface topology differently.
2. **Electrode Material & Surface Properties**: The inherent characteristics of
   electrodes used in MESS systems can impact biofilm formation patterns due to
   differences in wettability or charge transfer properties that selectively
   favor certain microbial adhesion and growth structures, thereby affecting
   roughness levels.
3. **Nutrient Availability & Medium Composition**: The concentration of
   nutrients within the electrolyte medium can influence biofilm density as well
   as morphology—leading to variations in surface texture due to differential
   microbial prol0ductivity and extracellular matrix deposition rates.
4. **Flow Dynamics (in flow-through systems)**: Fluid shear forces acting on the
   electrode surfaces can erode or smooth out biofilm structures, thereby
   altering roughness characteristics—especially in dynamic MESS configurations
   where liquid movement is a key operational aspect for mass transport and
   electron transfer processes.

## Performance Impact

Biofilm surface topology directly impacts microbial attachment efficiency to
electrode surfaces; consequently influencing the bioelectrochemical conversion
rates within these systems:

- Greater roughness can enhance bacterial adhesion, increasing active biocathode
  area and potentially improving electron transfer due to more extensive contact
  points. However, excessively high surface irregularities may impede nutrient
  transport or cause biofilm detachment issues during system operation—thus
  reducing overall efficiency.
- Conversely, overly smooth surfaces might not provide sufficient microhabitat
  complexity for optimal bacterial colonization and electron transfer processes;
  thus potentially leading to suboptimal performance in terms of current
  generation within MESS devices.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges are typically between the minimum roughness needed to ensure
adequate biofilm adhesion without excessive detachment, around a median value
conducive for electron transfer and nutrient transport balance—around an average
range of approximately:

- **Minimum** (to prevent desiccation or shear stress): 0.5 - 1.0 μm
- Acceptable Range (for optimal performance without structural integrity
  issues): ~2 to 30 μm, with a preferred target within the established 'optimal'
  range of approximately: [7] –[14] μm for balanced biofilm growth and electron
  transfer. Validation should confirm that roughness measurements are consistent
  across multiple sampling points on an electrode surface in order to account
  for heterogeneous distribution patterns inherent with biological systems,
  ensuring representative data collection within the operational context of MESS
  devices.
