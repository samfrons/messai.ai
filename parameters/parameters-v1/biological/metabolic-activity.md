# Metabolic Activity

## Definition

The "Metabolic Activity" parameter in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS)
quantifies the proportion of active biomass engaged in bioelectrochemical
reactions, directly influencing system efficiency and electricity generation
capabilities. It reflects how effectively the metabolically-active cells convert
substrates into electrical energy or valuable chemical products through their
interaction with electrodes within MESS devices.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0% - 100%] % (as some biomass may be inert)
- **Typical**: Between 65% and 90%, where higher values indicate more active
  metabolic processes contributing to current generation.
- **Optimal**: Typically, a Metabolic Activity above 80% is considered optimal
  for efficient electricity production or chemical synthesis within MESS systems
  without overloading the microbial population'dictory capacity of the system.

## Measurement Methods

Metabolic activity can be measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) to assess changes in electrical conductivity correlated with active
biomass presence, or by quantifying substrate consumption and product generation
rates through chemical analysis of the system's effluent. Additionally,
fluorescent biosensors can be used for real-time monitoring when coupled with
microscopic techniques to visualize metabolically engaged cells directly at
electrode surfaces.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Substrate Concentration**: Higher substrate availability generally
   increases the active biomass fraction, up until a saturation point where
   additional excess does not translate into increased activity due to
   limitations in transport or enzymatic processing rates within microbial
   cells.
2. **Electrode Material and Surface Area**: The electrode's material properties
   (e.g., conductivity) along with its surface area can significantly influence
   the efficiency of electron transfer from active biomass, thereby affecting
   metabolic activity levels in MESS systems.
3. **pH Levels & Temperature Control**: Optimal pH and temperature are crucial
   for maintaining microbial health; deviations may lead to reduced enzymatic
   activities or cell death which can lower the Metabolically Active Fraction
   (MAF).
4. **Microorganism Selection/Engineering**: The inherent metabolic capabilities
   of selected strains, as well as genetic modifications aimed at optimizing
   electron transfer pathways and substrate utilization efficiency directly
   impact MAF measurements within MESS systems.

## Performance Impact

Higher Metabolic Activity correlates with increased current generation in
microbial fuel cells (MFCs) or enhanced production rates of valuable chemical
products via bioelectrochemical synthesis, thereby improving the overall
performance and productivity metrics for industrial applications within MESS
systems. Conversely, low metabolic activity may indicate suboptimal system
conditions leading to reduced efficiency in energy harvesting processes.

## Validation Rules

- **Acceptable Range**: The Metabolically Active Fraction should remain between
  65% and 90%. Values outside this range could suggest issues with microbial
  health, electrode performance or system design flaws that require immediate
  attention for rectification to maintain optimal function.
