# ATP Concentration

## Definition

The ATP Concentration parameter refers to the intracellular concentration of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within microbial electrochemical systems (MESS).
This biological marker is critical for assessing cell metabolic activity and
energy production, which are directly linked to electricity generation in MESS.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 50 μM [min] – ATP concentration can vary widely depending on
  the microbial species used and environmental conditions within a bioreactor
  setup for electrochemical conversion processes.
- **Typical**: Approximately 30 μM, which is often found in well-optimized
  systems where cells are actively metabolizing substrates to generate
  electrical current via bioelectrochemical pathways.
- **Optimal**: The optimal range for performance may be between 40 - 60 μM as
  this concentration supports maximal electron transfer rates without causing
  cellular stress or inhibition, which is crucial for sustained and efficient
  system operation.

## Measurement Methods

ATP Concentration can typically be measured using luminescence-based assays such
as the firefly luciferase bioluminescence method where ATP reacting with its
substrate (luciferin) in presence of enzyme produces light. The intensity
correlates to ATP concentration, which is then quantified by photodetection
equipment like luminometers or plate readers calibrated for this specific assay
range and sensitivity requirements within the MESS context.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Substrate Availability**: The presence of substrates that microbes can
   metabolize to generate ATP directly affects intracellular concentrations;
   limited availability may lead to lower levels, while abundant supply could
   increase them up until a saturation point is reached or leads to inhibitory
   effects.
2. **Environmental Conditions**: Temperature and pH can influence microbial
   metabolism rates which subsequently affect ATP production within the cells;
   extreme conditions may reduce cell viability, thus lowering intracellular
   concentrations of energy carriers like ATP.
3. **Microorganisms' Health/Strain Selection**: Different strains or species
   have varying capacities for producing and maintaining high levels of internal
   metabolites such as ATP; robust microbial cultures tend to sustain higher
   intracellular concentrations, while weakened ones may not produce sufficient
   energy carriers.
4. **Electrode Surface Interactions**: The biofilm formation on electrodes can
   affect the availability of substrates and electron transfer rates which in
   turn influences ATP synthesis; well-established biofilms generally correlate
   with higher intracellular concentrations due to efficient metabolic
   processes.

## Performance Impact

ATP Concentration is directly related to microbial respiration rate, a key
driver of electricity generation in MESS systems as it determines the amount and
speed at which electrons are transferred from biological entities (microbes)
through an electrochemical circuit for energy harvesting. Higher ATP
concentrations typically indicate active metabolism leading to increased current
output; conversely, low levels may signify reduced microbial activity or
systemic inefficien0cies potentially resulting in diminished electrical
generation and overall performance of the MESS device.

## Validation Rules

- **Minimum Acceptable Concentration**: 15 μM – Below this threshold, ATP levels
  may indicate suboptimal microbial activity or system malfunctioning that
  requires investigation to prevent further decline in output efficiency and
  cell health.
- **Maximum Sustainable Threshold**: Not typically defined due to potential
  negative feedback mechanisms; however, concentrations significantly above the
  optimal range (e.g., >60 μM) may suggest metabolic stress or substrate
  overload that could lead to reduced longevity and performance of both microbes
  and electrodes within a MESS system.
- **Consistency Range**: Fluctuating values outside narrow bands should be
  investigated for possible causes such as fluctuations in environmental
  conditions, inconsistent feeding rates or biofilm development issues; stable
  readings are indicative of well-regulated and functionally efficient systems.
