# Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii

## Definition

In microbial electrochemical systems (MESS), "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii" refers
to a model green alga used for bioelectrochemical studies due to its
photosynthetic capabilities and ability to transfer electrons under anoxic
conditions. This parameter is critical in assessing the efficiency of electron
transport from phototrophic activity within MESS systems, where Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii acts as a biocathode or bioanode depending on system design.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 1x10^6 - 5x10^8 cells/mL (cell density)
- **Typical**: Around 3x10^7 cells/mL for optimal biofilm formation and electron
  transfer rates.
- **Optimal**: Cell densities in the range of 4x10^7 - 5x10^8 cells/mL to
  maximize system performance due to increased metabolic activity without
  causing self-shading or overcrowding, which can hinder electron transfer
  efficiency.

## Measurement Methods

Cell density is typically measured using spectrophotometric methods by
quantifying the optical absorbance at specific wavelength (usually around 600
nm) corresponding to chlorophyll concentration or through direct counting with a
hemocytometer after staining. Electrochemical impedance measurements can also be
used as an indirect method for estimating cell density and biofilm thickness,
which correlates closely with the biological activity of Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii within MESS systems.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Light Intensity**: Optimal light levels are crucial to maintain
   photosynthetic efficiency without causing photoinhibition or excessive
   self-shading among cells, which can reduce the rate of electron transfer and
   overall system performance.
2. **Nutrient Availability**: Adequate supply of essential nutrients like
   nitrogen sources (e.g., ammonium) is necessary for cell growth; deficiencies
   could limit biocathode or bioanode activity, reducing electron transfer rates
   and system efficiency.
3. **pH Levels**: The algal cells' metabolism can alter the pH of their
   environment; maintaining a neutral to slightly alkaline range (around 7-8) is
   essential for optimal growth conditions in most MESS systems using
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as an electrogenic species.
4. **Temperature**: The temperature must be maintained within the physiological
   comfort zone of approximately 20°C to prevent thermal stress, which could
   negatively impact cell metabolism and electron transfer rates in MESS
   systems.

## Performance Impact

The density of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii directly influences system performance
by affecting both biofilm formation on electrodes (which is essential for
efficient biocathode or bioanode function) as well as the rate at which
electrons are transferred from photosynthesis to an external circuit. High cell
densities can lead to increased electron production, but only up until a point
where self-shading and overcrowding become detrimental—thus there is typically
an optimal range for performance enhancement without negative effects due to
excessive biomass accumulation or light limitation within the culture medium.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable cell density ranges should be maintained between 3x10^7 - 5x10^8
cells/mL, with specific validation criteria including:

- Absorbance readings corresponding to expected chlorophyll concentration for
  given densities (typically around A600nm = 0.4).
- Electrochemical impedance measurements showing consistent biofilm formation
  without signs of overgrowth or inhibition, which could indicate suboptimal
  cell density conditions within the system.
