# Enzyme Activity

## Definition

Enzyme Activity in Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESS) refers to the rate
at extrinsic metabolic reactions catalyzed by enzymes present within
microorganisms used as biocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion
processes. It quantifies how efficiently these organisms can convert substrates
into electrical current under specific operational conditions, typically
measured in units of activity per milligram of protein (U/mg).

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0 - 15] U/mg protein for common microbial strains used.
- **Typical**: Between 3 to 7 U/mg, depending on the organism and operational
  conditions.
- **Optimal**: Approximately between 6 to 9 U/mg is often associated with high
  system performance due to balanced metabolic rates that optimize substrate
  conversion without overburdening cellular machinery or causing inhibitory
  byproduct accumulation.

## Measurement Methods

Enzyme activity can be measured using spectrophotometric assays, where the rate
of product formation correlates with enzymatic action under controlled
conditions. Alternatively, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) may also
provide insights into metabolic rates by monitoring changes in current
associated with substrate conversion and electron transfer processes within
microbial cells immobilized on an electrode surface.

## Affecting Factors

1. **Temperature**: Optimal temperature for enzyme function, typically between
   30-40°C (68-104°F) in most mesophilic microorganisms used within MESS
   systems; deviations can lead to decreased activity or denaturation of the
   proteins.
2. **pH**: Each enzyme has an optimal pH range, often between 5 and 7 for many
   biocatalysts in aqueous solutions employed in electrochemical cells.
   Deviation from this optimum can lead to reduced catalytic efficiency or
   irreversible denaturation of the protein structure.
3. **Substrate Concentr0ution**: Availability and concentration gradients
   directly impact enzyme kinetics; too low substrates may not saturate
   microbial metabolism, while excessively high concentrations can lead to
   inhibitory effects or diffusional limitations across the biofilm.
4. **Immobilization Method**: The technique used for immobilizing cells (such as
   entrapment within a gel matrix) influences enzyme accessibility and
   stability; poorly chosen methods may result in decreased activity due to
   steric hindrance or diffusional barriers, which can impede substrate-enzyme
   interactions.

## Performance Impact

Enzymatic activities are critical for the conversion efficiency of microbial
cells into electrical current within MESS systems; higher enzyme activities
typically correlate with increased rates of bioelectricity generation due to
more effective catalysis and electron transfer processes at electrodes, directly
impacting energy yield. Suboptimal activity can lead to bottlenecks in metabolic
pathways or reduced surface contact between cells and the conductive matrix,
diminishing system performance significantly.

## Validation Rules

Acceptable ranges for enzyme activities should be within 10-25% of optimal
values under standardized testing conditions (37°C pH neutrality). Any
significant deviation outside this range may indicate suboptimal operational
parameters or cell health issues that require immediate investigation.
Systematic decline in activity over time can signal enzyme degradation,
immobilization failure, or microbial stress responses and should be monitored
closely for system longevity assessment.
