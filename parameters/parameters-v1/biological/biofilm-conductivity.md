# Biofilm Conductivity

## Definition

Biofilm Conductivity refers to the electrical conductance of microbial biofilms
within Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESS). It quantifies how effectively
electrons can be transferred through a biological layer, which is crucial for
processes like bacterial fuel cells and other forms of bioelectricity
generation.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: [0.1] - [50] S/m (Note that these values are approximate as they
  can vary significantly based on the specific microbial community, substrate
  concentration, temperature, etc.)
- **Typical**: Between 2 and 30 S/m for most operational MESS systems under
  controlled conditions.
- **Optimal**: [15] - [40] S/m is considered optimal to ensure efficient
  electron transfer while maintaining biofilm integrity without overloading the
  system'dictory capacity or causing excessive biomass growth that could lead to
  clogging and decreased performance efficiency.

## Measurement Methods

Biofilm conductivity can be measured using electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS), which allows for non-invasive monitoring of the
bioelectrical properties within a MESS system over time, or by direct current
measurements through microbial fuel cells. The latter method involves connecting
an external circuit to measure voltage and calculating conductivity based on
Ohm's law: Conductance (G) = Current (I)/Voltage (V).

## Affecting Factors

1. **Microbial Community Composition** - Different microbes have varying
   electron transfer capabilities, which can significantly impact biofilm
   electrical conductivity.
2. **Biofilm Thickness and Porosity** – The physical structure of the biofilm
   influences ionic mobility within it; thicker or denser films may impede
   current flow more than thin ones with higher porosity.
3. **Substrate Availability & Type** - Substances that microbes metabolize can
   affect their electron transfer rates, thus influencing conductivity levels in
   the biofilm matrix.
4. **Environmental Conditions (Temperature and pH)** – These factors impact both
   biological activity within the MESS system as well as electrochemical
   properties of materials involved which subsequently influence electrical
   connectivity between microbes.

## Performance Impact

Higher conductivity in biofilms generally correlates with better performance for
energy generation, due to more efficient electron transfer from metabolic
processes directly into an external circuit within the MESS system. Conversely,
low or inconsistent electroconductivities can lead to reduced power output and
signal instability which may impair overall efficiency of bioelectricity
conversion systems like microbial fuel cells (MFCs).

## Validation Rules

Valid conductivity measurements should fall within the typical range for
operational MESS, with values outside this bracket indicating potential issues
such as systemic inefficiencies or measurement errors. Specific criteria may
include:

- Conductance must be nonzero to ensure active biofilm presence and functioning
  electron transfer capability; however, excessively high conductivities could
  suggest overgrowth problems that need addressal for optimal performance
  maintenance.
- Values should not fluctuate widely within short periods as this may indicate
  instability in the microbial community or environmental conditions affecting
  biofilm integrity and function. Acceptable ranges are typically defined by
  operational benchmarks established through empirical studies of similar
  systems, with variations expected due to different system designs and
  operating environments; thus a range from [15] - [40] S/m can be considered
  valid for many MESS applications based on current understanding (as per
  typical values).
