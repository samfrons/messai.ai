# Biogas Yield

## Definition

Biogas yield quantifies the volume of biogas produced per unit mass of substrate
in microbial electrochemical systems designed for combined electricity
generation and biogas production. This parameter indicates the efficiency of
organic matter conversion to gaseous products and represents an important energy
recovery metric in integrated bioelectrochemical systems.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 100 - 800 mL biogas/g COD
- **Typical**: 300 - 600 mL biogas/g COD
- **Optimal**: 400 - 700 mL biogas/g COD

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <300 mL/g COD (poor conversion efficiency)
- **Moderate Performance**: 300 - 450 mL/g COD (moderate efficiency)
- **High Performance**: 450 - 650 mL/g COD (good efficiency)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >650 mL/g COD (excellent conversion)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Gas Volume Measurement**:

   - Collect biogas in graduated cylinders or gas bags
   - Measure volume at standard temperature and pressure
   - Normalize by substrate mass or COD consumed
   - Account for gas composition (CH₄, CO₂, H₂S)

2. **Gas Flow Meter**:
   - Continuous measurement of gas production rate
   - Integrate flow over time for total volume
   - Real-time monitoring capability
   - Requires regular calibration

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize to standard temperature and pressure (STP)
- Account for gas composition when calculating energy content
- Consider background gas production from controls
- Use COD removed rather than COD added for accuracy

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Type**:

   - Carbohydrates: 740 mL biogas/g COD (theoretical)
   - Proteins: 700 mL biogas/g COD (theoretical)
   - Lipids: 1400 mL biogas/g COD (theoretical)
   - Mixed organic waste: Variable yields

2. **Operating Conditions**:

   - Temperature: Higher temperature generally increases yield
   - pH: Optimal range 6.8-7.2 for methanogenesis
   - Hydraulic retention time: Longer HRT improves yield
   - Organic loading rate: Affects conversion efficiency

3. **Microbial Community**:
   - Methanogenic activity level
   - Syntrophic relationships
   - Community balance and stability
   - Adaptation to substrate and conditions

### Secondary Factors

1. **System Design**:

   - Reactor configuration affects mass transfer
   - Mixing efficiency influences biogas yield
   - Temperature control affects microbial activity
   - Gas collection efficiency

2. **Inhibitory Factors**:
   - Ammonia toxicity at high concentrations
   - Heavy metals can inhibit methanogens
   - Sulfide toxicity affects biogas production
   - Volatile fatty acid accumulation

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Theoretical yield = 350 mL CH₄/g COD + 260 mL CO₂/g COD = 610 mL
biogas/g COD

Higher biogas yields indicate better organic matter conversion and energy
recovery. Combined with electricity generation, biogas yield determines total
energy recovery efficiency. Optimal yields maximize overall system energy output
and economic viability.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 1500 mL biogas/g COD
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mL biogas/g COD or m³/kg COD
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with COD removal efficiency
4. **Outlier detection**: Yields >800 mL/g COD unusual without pretreatment
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed theoretical maximum for substrate
   type
