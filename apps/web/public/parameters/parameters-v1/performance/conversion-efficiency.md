# Conversion Efficiency

## Definition

Conversion efficiency quantifies the percentage of input substrate that is
successfully converted to desired products in microbial electrochemical systems.
This parameter measures the effectiveness of the bioelectrochemical process in
transforming feedstock into useful outputs such as electricity, hydrogen, or
valuable chemicals. Higher conversion efficiency indicates better resource
utilization and economic viability.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 95 %
- **Typical**: 40 - 80 %
- **Optimal**: 70 - 90 %

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <30% (poor substrate utilization)
- **Moderate Performance**: 30 - 60% (basic conversion)
- **High Performance**: 60 - 85% (good conversion)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >85% (excellent conversion)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Mass Balance Method**:

   - Monitor substrate input and product output
   - Calculate: Efficiency = (Product formed/Substrate consumed) × 100%
   - Account for all major products and byproducts
   - Use COD or carbon balance for complex substrates

2. **Stoichiometric Analysis**:
   - Compare actual yields to theoretical maximum
   - Calculate based on balanced chemical equations
   - Account for competing reactions
   - More accurate for defined substrates

### Calculation Considerations

- Include all significant products in calculations
- Account for biomass formation as product
- Consider incomplete substrate conversion

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Type**:

   - Simple organics (acetate): 80-95% efficiency
   - Complex organics (cellulose): 40-70% efficiency
   - Wastewater: 30-60% efficiency (variable composition)

2. **System Design**:

   - Optimized configurations: Higher efficiency
   - Mass transfer limitations: Reduced efficiency
   - Residence time: Affects completion of conversion

3. **Operating Conditions**:
   - Optimal pH, temperature: Maximum efficiency
   - Stress conditions: Reduced conversion
   - Substrate loading: Affects conversion completeness

### Secondary Factors

1. **Microbial Community**:

   - Specialized communities: Higher efficiency
   - Mixed communities: Variable efficiency
   - Community stability: Consistent conversion

2. **Competing Processes**:
   - Methanogenesis: Reduces electrical conversion
   - Fermentation: Alternative product pathways
   - Maintenance metabolism: Non-productive consumption

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: ηconversion = (Actual Product Yield/Theoretical Yield) × 100%

High conversion efficiency (>80%) maximizes resource utilization and economic
returns. Low efficiency (<40%) indicates process limitations and potential for
optimization through improved conditions or system design.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 100 %
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as percentage
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with product yields
4. **Outlier detection**: >95% requires verification of calculations
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed 100%
