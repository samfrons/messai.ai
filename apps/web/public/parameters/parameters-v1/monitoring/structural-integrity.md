# Structural Integrity

## Definition

Structural integrity quantifies the ability of microbial electrochemical system
components to maintain their structural soundness and functional performance
under operating conditions. This parameter encompasses mechanical strength,
fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and overall system reliability.
Maintaining structural integrity is essential for safe operation, performance
consistency, and system longevity.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0 - 100% (integrity index)
- **Typical**: 80 - 95%
- **Optimal**: >90%

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <70% (poor integrity, safety concerns)
- **Moderate Performance**: 70 - 85% (moderate integrity, monitoring needed)
- **High Performance**: 85 - 95% (good integrity, normal operation)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >95% (excellent integrity, minimal risk)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)**:
   - Ultrasonic testing for crack detection
   - Radiographic examination for internal defects
   - Magnetic particle inspection for surface cracks
   - Penetrant testing for surface discontinuities

2. **Structural Health Monitoring**:
   - Strain gauge measurements
   - Vibration analysis and modal testing
   - Acoustic emission monitoring
   - Real-time stress and deflection monitoring

3. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Regular visual examination of components
   - Photographic documentation of changes
   - Measurement of deformation or displacement
   - Assessment of surface condition

### Calculation Considerations

- Integrity Index = (Current Performance) / (Design Performance) Ã— 100%
- Account for multiple failure modes
- Consider cumulative damage effects
- Weight different components by criticality

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Material Properties**:
   - Corrosion resistance affects longevity
   - Fatigue strength influences cyclic loading tolerance
   - Thermal expansion affects thermal stress
   - Material compatibility prevents degradation

2. **Operating Conditions**:
   - Pressure and temperature cycling
   - Chemical exposure and pH effects
   - Mechanical loading and vibration
   - Environmental conditions

3. **Design Factors**:
   - Safety factors and design margins
   - Stress concentration areas
   - Joint design and welding quality
   - Structural redundancy

### Secondary Factors

1. **Maintenance History**:
   - Preventive maintenance quality
   - Repair history and methods
   - Component replacement timing
   - Inspection frequency

2. **Age and Usage**:
   - Cumulative operating hours
   - Number of startup/shutdown cycles
   - Exposure to extreme conditions
   - Historical performance trends

## Performance Impact

High structural integrity (>90%) ensures safe operation, reliable performance,
and minimal unplanned downtime. Low integrity (<70%) increases failure risk,
safety hazards, and maintenance costs. Regular monitoring enables predictive
maintenance and prevents catastrophic failures.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 100%
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as percentage or integrity index
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with age and operating conditions
4. **Outlier detection**: Sudden drops require immediate investigation
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must reflect actual component condition
