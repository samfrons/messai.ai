# Model Accuracy

## Definition

Model accuracy quantifies how precisely predictive models estimate actual
performance parameters in microbial electrochemical systems, typically expressed
as percentage error or correlation coefficient. This parameter indicates the
reliability of AI-driven predictions and system models used for design
optimization and operational control. Higher accuracy enables better
decision-making and system optimization.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 50 - 99%
- **Typical**: 75 - 90%
- **Optimal**: 85 - 95%

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <70% (poor prediction reliability)
- **Moderate Performance**: 70 - 80% (moderate reliability)
- **High Performance**: 80 - 90% (good reliability)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >90% (excellent prediction accuracy)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Cross-Validation Analysis**:

   - Split data into training and validation sets
   - Calculate prediction error on validation data
   - Use k-fold cross-validation for robustness
   - Report mean accuracy and confidence intervals

2. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:

   - Calculate: MAPE = (1/n) × Σ|((Actual - Predicted)/Actual)| × 100%
   - Compare predicted vs actual values
   - Provides intuitive percentage error
   - Good for comparing different models

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (R²)
   - Measure linear relationship strength
   - Values near 1.0 indicate high accuracy
   - Widely used metric for model validation

### Calculation Considerations

- Use appropriate metrics for different data types
- Account for model uncertainty and confidence intervals
- Consider both systematic and random errors
- Validate on independent test datasets

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Model Type and Complexity**:

   - Machine learning models: Variable accuracy
   - Physical models: Good for understood phenomena
   - Hybrid models: Often best performance
   - Deep learning: High accuracy with sufficient data

2. **Training Data Quality**:

   - Data quantity affects model performance
   - Data diversity improves generalization
   - Measurement accuracy limits model accuracy
   - Data preprocessing affects results

3. **System Complexity**:
   - Simple systems: Higher accuracy possible
   - Complex multivariate systems: Lower accuracy
   - Non-linear behaviors: Challenging to model
   - Time-varying systems: Reduced accuracy

### Secondary Factors

1. **Model Development Process**:

   - Feature selection affects performance
   - Hyperparameter optimization improves accuracy
   - Ensemble methods often improve results
   - Regular model updates maintain accuracy

2. **Application Domain**:
   - Current prediction: Often 85-95% accurate
   - Power output: Typically 80-90% accurate
   - Long-term performance: 70-85% accurate
   - Failure prediction: 60-80% accurate

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Decision quality ∝ model accuracy × model relevance

Higher model accuracy (>85%) enables confident automated decision-making and
optimization. Moderate accuracy (70-85%) requires human oversight and
validation. Low accuracy (<70%) limits model utility and may require model
improvement or different approaches.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 100%
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as % accuracy or R² coefficient
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with training data quality and model
   complexity
4. **Outlier detection**: Accuracy >98% requires verification against
   overfitting
5. **Physical plausibility**: Perfect accuracy (100%) impossible due to
   measurement noise
