# Sampling Rate

## Definition

Sampling rate quantifies the frequency at which data acquisition systems collect
measurements from microbial electrochemical systems, typically expressed as
samples per second or measurement interval. This parameter determines the
temporal resolution of monitoring systems and affects the ability to capture
transient events and system dynamics. Optimal sampling rates balance data
quality with system resources.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.001 - 1000 Hz
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 10 Hz
- **Optimal**: 1 - 5 Hz

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.01 Hz (insufficient temporal resolution)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.01 - 0.1 Hz (basic monitoring)
- **High Performance**: 0.1 - 10 Hz (good resolution)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 1 - 100 Hz (high-resolution monitoring)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Data Acquisition System Configuration**:

   - Set sampling frequency in DAQ software
   - Monitor actual vs configured sampling rate
   - Check for sampling rate drift or instability
   - Verify timing accuracy with reference signals

2. **Time Stamp Analysis**:
   - Analyze time stamps in data records
   - Calculate actual sampling intervals
   - Identify sampling irregularities
   - Measure sampling jitter and stability

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for anti-aliasing filter requirements
- Consider Nyquist frequency for signal bandwidth
- Balance sampling rate with data storage requirements
- Account for system processing limitations

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Signal Characteristics**:

   - Signal bandwidth determines minimum rate
   - Transient events require higher rates
   - Steady-state parameters need lower rates
   - Noise characteristics affect optimal rate

2. **System Dynamics**:

   - Fast bioelectrochemical responses: 1-100 Hz
   - Slow biofilm development: 0.001-0.01 Hz
   - Temperature variations: 0.01-1 Hz
   - Flow rate changes: 0.1-10 Hz

3. **Measurement Type**:
   - Voltage/current: 1-1000 Hz
   - pH/temperature: 0.01-1 Hz
   - Flow rates: 0.1-10 Hz
   - Gas composition: 0.001-0.1 Hz

### Secondary Factors

1. **System Resources**:

   - Data storage capacity limits
   - Processing power constraints
   - Network bandwidth limitations
   - Power consumption considerations

2. **Application Requirements**:
   - Real-time control needs higher rates
   - Historical trending needs lower rates
   - Alarm detection requires appropriate rates
   - Research applications may need maximum rates

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Data quality ∝ log(sampling rate) up to Nyquist frequency

Higher sampling rates improve temporal resolution and event detection
capability. However, excessive sampling (>100× signal bandwidth) wastes
resources without improving data quality. Optimal sampling (2-10× signal
bandwidth) captures system dynamics efficiently.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.0001 - 10,000 Hz
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in Hz (samples per second) or s (sampling
   interval)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should relate to signal bandwidth and system dynamics
4. **Outlier detection**: Rates >1000 Hz unusual for most bioelectrochemical
   applications
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by sensor response time and system
   capabilities
