# Reactor Geometry

## Definition

Reactor geometry describes the physical shape, dimensions, and spatial
configuration of microbial electrochemical system reactors, including chamber
design, electrode placement, and flow patterns. This parameter affects mass
transfer, mixing, current distribution, and overall system performance. Optimal
geometry balances efficient mass transport with practical manufacturing and
operational considerations.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: Various configurations (cylindrical, rectangular, tubular)
- **Typical**: Rectangular chambers, cylindrical tubes
- **Optimal**: Application-specific optimization

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: Poor mass transfer, dead zones
- **Moderate Performance**: Adequate mixing, some inefficiencies
- **High Performance**: Good mass transfer, uniform distribution
- **Exceptional Performance**: Optimized for specific application

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Dimensional Analysis**:

   - Length, width, height measurements
   - Volume calculations from dimensions
   - Aspect ratio determination
   - Surface area to volume ratios

2. **Flow Visualization**:

   - Tracer studies for flow patterns
   - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   - Residence time distribution analysis
   - Dead zone identification

3. **3D Scanning**:
   - Precise geometric characterization
   - Complex geometry documentation
   - Quality control for manufacturing
   - Design verification

### Calculation Considerations

- Consider working volume vs total volume
- Account for internal structures (electrodes, baffles)
- Analyze flow patterns and mixing characteristics
- Evaluate heat and mass transfer implications

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Application Requirements**:

   - Laboratory research: Small, controlled geometries
   - Wastewater treatment: Flow-through designs
   - Power generation: Optimized for current collection
   - Pilot testing: Scalable geometries

2. **Scale Considerations**:

   - Laboratory scale: 10 mL - 1 L
   - Pilot scale: 1 L - 1000 L
   - Commercial scale: >1000 L
   - Manufacturing constraints

3. **Process Requirements**:
   - Mass transfer needs
   - Mixing requirements
   - Gas handling capabilities
   - Maintenance accessibility

### Secondary Factors

1. **Economic Factors**:

   - Manufacturing costs
   - Material utilization efficiency
   - Installation requirements
   - Operational complexity

2. **Operational Factors**:
   - Cleanability and maintenance
   - Monitoring access points
   - Safety considerations
   - Modular design possibilities

## Performance Impact

Reactor geometry affects current distribution, mass transfer, and mixing
efficiency. Optimized geometries improve power density and treatment efficiency
while reducing capital and operating costs. Poor geometry can create dead zones,
non-uniform current distribution, and reduced performance.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: Depends on specific dimensional parameters
2. **Unit consistency**: Use consistent units (mm, cm, m)
3. **Correlation checks**: Geometry should match application requirements
4. **Outlier detection**: Unusual aspect ratios or configurations require
   justification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be manufacturable and operable
