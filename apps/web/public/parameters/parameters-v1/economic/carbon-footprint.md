# Carbon Footprint

## Definition

Carbon footprint quantifies the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with
microbial electrochemical systems throughout their lifecycle, expressed as CO₂
equivalent emissions per unit of energy produced or treated volume. This
parameter enables environmental impact assessment and supports carbon accounting
for sustainability reporting. Lower carbon footprints indicate better
environmental performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: -2 to 5 kg CO₂-eq/MWh
- **Typical**: -1 to 2 kg CO₂-eq/MWh
- **Optimal**: -2 to 0 kg CO₂-eq/MWh (net negative or neutral)

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >2 kg CO₂-eq/MWh (net positive emissions)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0 - 2 kg CO₂-eq/MWh (low net emissions)
- **High Performance**: -1 to 0 kg CO₂-eq/MWh (carbon neutral to negative)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <-1 kg CO₂-eq/MWh (strongly carbon negative)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**:

   - Cradle-to-grave emissions analysis
   - Include material production, operation, disposal
   - Use LCA software (SimaPro, GaBi, etc.)
   - Follow ISO 14040/14044 standards

2. **Process-Based Accounting**:

   - Direct measurement of operational emissions
   - Material flow analysis
   - Energy consumption tracking
   - Waste stream characterization

3. **Hybrid Assessment**:
   - Combine process-based and input-output methods
   - Use databases (ecoinvent, GHG Protocol)
   - Account for upstream and downstream impacts
   - Include avoided emissions from waste treatment

### Calculation Considerations

- Define system boundaries clearly
- Include all significant emission sources
- Account for temporal variations in grid electricity
- Consider displaced emissions from avoided treatments

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **System Efficiency**:

   - Higher energy efficiency reduces footprint
   - Power density affects material intensity
   - Substrate utilization efficiency
   - System lifetime affects amortized impacts

2. **Substrate Type**:

   - Waste substrates: Often negative footprint
   - Purpose-grown biomass: Higher footprint
   - Organic waste diversion: Avoided landfill emissions
   - Wastewater treatment: Avoided treatment emissions

3. **Energy Mix**:
   - Grid electricity carbon intensity
   - Renewable energy integration
   - On-site renewable generation
   - Energy storage requirements

### Secondary Factors

1. **Material Selection**:

   - Electrode materials: Carbon vs precious metals
   - Membrane materials: Polymer production impacts
   - System construction materials
   - Transportation distances

2. **End-of-Life Treatment**:
   - Material recycling potential
   - Disposal method impacts
   - Component reuse opportunities
   - Decommissioning energy requirements

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Net footprint = Direct emissions + Embodied emissions - Avoided
emissions

Negative carbon footprints (-2 to 0 kg CO₂-eq/MWh) indicate net environmental
benefits through waste treatment and renewable energy generation. Positive
footprints (>0 kg CO₂-eq/MWh) suggest need for system optimization or different
applications.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: -10 to 20 kg CO₂-eq/MWh
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in kg CO₂-eq/MWh or g CO₂-eq/kWh
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with system efficiency and substrate
   type
4. **Outlier detection**: Footprints <-5 or >10 kg CO₂-eq/MWh require
   verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by carbon content of system inputs
