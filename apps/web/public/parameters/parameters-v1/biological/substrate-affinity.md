# Substrate Affinity

## Definition

Substrate affinity quantifies the binding strength and specificity of microbial
enzymes and transport systems for specific substrates in microbial
electrochemical systems. This parameter reflects how efficiently microorganisms
can capture and utilize substrates at low concentrations. Higher substrate
affinity enables effective operation at lower substrate concentrations and
improved competition for limited resources.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 100 L/g/h
- **Typical**: 1 - 20 L/g/h
- **Optimal**: 5 - 50 L/g/h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1 L/g/h (poor substrate affinity)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1 - 5 L/g/h (moderate affinity)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 20 L/g/h (good affinity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >20 L/g/h (excellent affinity)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Competitive Uptake Studies**:
   - Measure substrate uptake in mixed substrate conditions
   - Calculate relative affinity constants
   - Use Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis
   - Compare uptake rates vs concentration

2. **Low Concentration Kinetics**:
   - Test substrate utilization at very low concentrations
   - Determine specific affinity: qmax/Ks
   - Use sensitive analytical methods
   - Account for mass transfer limitations

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by biomass concentration
- Account for multiple substrate interactions
- Consider enzyme induction effects

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Type**:
   - Preferred substrates: High affinity (10-100 L/g/h)
   - Alternative substrates: Moderate affinity (1-10 L/g/h)
   - Non-preferred substrates: Low affinity (<1 L/g/h)

2. **Enzyme Systems**:
   - High-affinity transporters: Greater affinity
   - Constitutive enzymes: Constant affinity
   - Inducible enzymes: Variable affinity

3. **Microbial Adaptation**:
   - Adapted populations: Higher affinity
   - Unadapted populations: Lower affinity
   - Long-term exposure increases affinity

### Secondary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Optimal pH/temperature: Maximum affinity
   - Stress conditions: Reduced affinity
   - Nutrient limitation: May increase affinity

2. **Competition**:
   - Multiple substrates: Competitive inhibition
   - Mixed cultures: Competition effects
   - Inhibitor presence: Reduced apparent affinity

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Affinity = qmax/Ks = μmax/(Ks × Y)

Higher substrate affinity enables efficient substrate utilization at low
concentrations, crucial for wastewater treatment applications. Systems with high
affinity (>10 L/g/h) can achieve >90% substrate removal even at low influent
concentrations.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 1000 L/g/h
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in L/g/h
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with low-concentration performance
4. **Outlier detection**: >100 L/g/h unusual for most substrates
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by enzyme kinetics
