# Enzyme Activity

## Definition

Enzyme activity quantifies the catalytic activity of key metabolic enzymes in
microbial electrochemical systems, measured as the amount of substrate converted
or product formed per unit time per unit enzyme protein. This parameter reflects
the functional capacity of the microbial community and directly impacts
substrate processing rates, electron transfer efficiency, and overall system
performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 500 U/mg protein
- **Typical**: 5 - 50 U/mg protein
- **Optimal**: 20 - 100 U/mg protein

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <5 U/mg protein (low enzyme expression)
- **Moderate Performance**: 5 - 20 U/mg protein (normal activity)
- **High Performance**: 20 - 100 U/mg protein (enhanced activity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >100 U/mg protein (optimal conditions)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Spectrophotometric Enzyme Assays**:
   - Monitor substrate disappearance or product formation
   - Use specific wavelengths for chromogenic substrates
   - Calculate activity: ΔA/min × factor/protein concentration
   - Standard unit: 1 U = 1 μmol/min at 25°C

2. **Fluorometric Assays**:
   - Higher sensitivity than spectrophotometric
   - Use fluorogenic substrates
   - Monitor fluorescence increase over time
   - Suitable for low enzyme concentrations

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by total protein content
- Account for temperature effects (Q₁₀ = 2-3)
- Use linear portion of activity curves

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Enzyme Type**:
   - Dehydrogenases: 10-200 U/mg (electron transfer)
   - Oxidases: 5-100 U/mg (terminal oxidation)
   - Reductases: 1-50 U/mg (electron acceptance)

2. **Growth Conditions**:
   - Optimal substrate: Maximum enzyme induction
   - Substrate limitation: Reduced enzyme synthesis
   - Alternative carbon sources affect enzyme profiles

3. **Cell Age**:
   - Log phase: Highest enzyme activity
   - Stationary phase: 50-70% of maximum
   - Death phase: Rapid activity decline

### Secondary Factors

1. **Temperature**:
   - Optimal temperature: Peak activity
   - Cold stress: Reduced enzyme synthesis
   - Heat stress: Enzyme denaturation

2. **pH**:
   - Each enzyme has optimal pH range
   - pH stress reduces activity and stability

## Performance Impact

High enzyme activity correlates with efficient substrate utilization and
electron transfer. Systems with total enzyme activity >50 U/mg protein typically
achieve 30-50% higher current densities than those with <20 U/mg protein. Key
enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase directly affect electron transfer efficiency.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 1000 U/mg protein
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as U/mg protein
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with metabolic rate
4. **Outlier detection**: >500 U/mg suggests highly active enzymes
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by protein turnover rates
