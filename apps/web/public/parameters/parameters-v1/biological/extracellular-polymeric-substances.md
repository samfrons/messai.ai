# Extracellular Polymeric Substances

## Definition

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) represent the complex mixture of high
molecular weight polymers secreted by microorganisms in biofilms within
microbial electrochemical systems. EPS consists primarily of polysaccharides,
proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that form the biofilm matrix, providing
structural integrity, protection, and facilitating electron transfer and
nutrient transport.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 500 mg/g biomass
- **Typical**: 50 - 200 mg/g biomass
- **Optimal**: 100 - 300 mg/g biomass

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <50 mg/g (weak biofilm structure)
- **Moderate Performance**: 50 - 100 mg/g (basic matrix formation)
- **High Performance**: 100 - 250 mg/g (robust biofilm)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >250 mg/g (highly structured matrix)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Extraction and Quantification**:

   - Extract EPS using cation exchange resin (CER)
   - Quantify polysaccharides using phenol-sulfuric acid method
   - Measure proteins using Bradford or Lowry assay
   - Determine nucleic acids by UV absorbance

2. **Microscopic Analysis**:
   - Stain EPS with specific fluorescent dyes
   - Use confocal laser scanning microscopy
   - Calculate EPS volume fraction in biofilm
   - ConA for polysaccharides, SYTO for nucleic acids

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by biofilm dry weight or volume
- Account for different EPS components separately
- Consider spatial distribution within biofilm

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Nutrient Availability**:

   - Carbon-rich conditions: Higher EPS production
   - Nitrogen limitation: Increased polysaccharide EPS
   - Phosphorus stress: Altered EPS composition

2. **Environmental Stress**:

   - Shear stress: Increased EPS production
   - pH stress: Enhanced protective EPS
   - Temperature stress: Modified EPS composition

3. **Growth Phase**:
   - Exponential phase: Lower EPS/biomass ratio
   - Stationary phase: Higher EPS production
   - Biofilm maturation: Maximum EPS accumulation

### Secondary Factors

1. **Microbial Species**:

   - Some species are high EPS producers
   - Species composition affects EPS properties
   - Pseudomonas and Bacillus: High EPS production

2. **Substrate Type**:
   - Complex substrates: More diverse EPS
   - Simple substrates: Basic EPS composition
   - Substrate concentration affects production rate

## Performance Impact

Optimal EPS levels (100-300 mg/g biomass) provide biofilm stability while
maintaining porosity for mass transfer. Excessive EPS (>400 mg/g) can limit
diffusion and reduce performance, while insufficient EPS (<50 mg/g) leads to
weak biofilm attachment.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 1 - 1000 mg/g biomass
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mg/g biomass
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with biofilm stability
4. **Outlier detection**: >500 mg/g requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed total biofilm mass
