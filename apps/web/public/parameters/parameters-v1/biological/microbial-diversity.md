# Microbial Diversity

## Definition

Microbial diversity quantifies the variety and richness of microorganisms
present in microbial electrochemical systems, typically measured using diversity
indices such as Shannon diversity or Simpson's index. This parameter reflects
ecosystem complexity, stability, and functional redundancy. Higher diversity
often correlates with system resilience, stability, and broader substrate
utilization capabilities.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0 - 8 (Shannon diversity index)
- **Typical**: 1.5 - 4.0
- **Optimal**: 2.5 - 4.5

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1.5 (low diversity, potential instability)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1.5 - 2.5 (moderate diversity)
- **High Performance**: 2.5 - 4.0 (high diversity, good stability)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >4.0 (very high diversity, excellent resilience)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **16S rRNA Gene Sequencing**:
   - Extract DNA from biofilm samples
   - Amplify 16S rRNA gene regions
   - Sequence and identify microbial taxa
   - Calculate diversity indices from abundance data

2. **Metagenomics**:
   - Whole genome shotgun sequencing
   - Taxonomic profiling from metagenomic data
   - Functional diversity assessment
   - More comprehensive than 16S analysis

### Calculation Considerations

- Shannon diversity: H' = -Σ(pi × ln(pi))
- Simpson's index: D = 1 - Σ(pi²)
- Consider both species richness and evenness
- Account for sampling depth and coverage

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Stable conditions: Lower diversity
   - Variable conditions: Higher diversity
   - Stress conditions: Reduced diversity

2. **Substrate Complexity**:
   - Complex substrates: Higher diversity
   - Simple substrates: Lower diversity
   - Multiple carbon sources: Increased diversity

3. **System Age**:
   - Young systems: Lower diversity
   - Mature systems: Higher diversity
   - Succession increases diversity over time

### Secondary Factors

1. **Operating Parameters**:
   - pH stability affects diversity
   - Temperature variations impact community structure
   - Hydraulic retention time influences selection

2. **Electrode Materials**:
   - Different materials select for different communities
   - Surface properties affect colonization
   - Material toxicity can reduce diversity

## Performance Impact

Higher microbial diversity (Shannon H' > 2.5) typically provides better system
stability, resilience to perturbations, and broader substrate utilization. Low
diversity (H' < 1.5) may indicate stressed conditions or system instability,
potentially leading to performance fluctuations.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 10 (Shannon index)
2. **Unit consistency**: Dimensionless index values
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with system stability
4. **Outlier detection**: >6 unusual for most microbial systems
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by sampling methodology and ecosystem size
