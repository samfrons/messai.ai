# Decay Rate

## Definition

Decay rate quantifies the rate of endogenous cellular decay and death in
microbial communities within electrochemical systems, representing the loss of
viable biomass over time due to natural mortality, maintenance energy
consumption, and stress conditions. This parameter is crucial for understanding
biofilm stability, long-term system performance, and biomass turnover dynamics.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.001 - 0.5 1/h
- **Typical**: 0.005 - 0.05 1/h
- **Optimal**: 0.01 - 0.03 1/h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >0.1 1/h (high cell death, stressed conditions)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.05 - 0.1 1/h (moderate decay)
- **High Performance**: 0.01 - 0.05 1/h (stable biomass)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <0.01 1/h (very stable conditions)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Biomass Balance Method**:
   - Monitor total biomass over time in absence of growth
   - Plot ln(biomass) vs time for exponential decay
   - Calculate slope: kd = -d(ln(X))/dt
   - Requires growth substrate limitation

2. **Viable Cell Counting**:
   - Track viable cell numbers over time
   - Use plate counting or viability stains
   - Distinguish from total cell numbers
   - More accurate for true decay rate

### Calculation Considerations

- Separate decay from growth phases
- Account for cell lysis vs viability loss
- Consider temperature and pH effects on decay

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Temperature**:
   - Q₁₀ = 2-3 for decay processes
   - Higher temperature: Faster decay
   - Optimal temperature: Minimum decay rate

2. **Substrate Availability**:
   - Starvation conditions: Higher decay (0.05-0.2 1/h)
   - Maintenance substrate: Lower decay (0.005-0.02 1/h)
   - Complete starvation: Maximum decay

3. **pH Stress**:
   - Optimal pH: Minimum decay rate
   - pH <5 or >9: Increased decay (2-10× higher)
   - Extreme pH: Rapid cell death

### Secondary Factors

1. **Toxic Compounds**:
   - Heavy metals increase decay rate
   - Organic toxins affect cell viability
   - Concentration-dependent effects

2. **Oxygen Conditions**:
   - Aerobic stress for anaerobes
   - Oxidative damage mechanisms
   - Optimal conditions minimize decay

## Performance Impact

Low decay rates ensure stable biofilm performance and sustained current
generation. Systems with decay rates <0.02 1/h typically maintain >90% biomass
activity over weeks, while those >0.05 1/h may require frequent biofilm
regeneration.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.0001 - 1 1/h
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as 1/h (per hour)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should increase with stress conditions
4. **Outlier detection**: >0.5 1/h indicates severe stress
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed maximum death rate
