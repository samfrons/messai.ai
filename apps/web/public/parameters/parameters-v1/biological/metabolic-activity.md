# Metabolic Activity

## Definition

Metabolic activity quantifies the rate of cellular metabolism within biofilms in
microbial electrochemical systems, typically measured as oxygen consumption
rate, carbon dioxide production, or substrate conversion rate. This parameter
reflects the overall physiological state and energy generation capacity of the
microbial community. High metabolic activity indicates active electron transfer
processes and substrate utilization.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 50 mmol O₂/L·h
- **Typical**: 2 - 15 mmol O₂/L·h
- **Optimal**: 5 - 20 mmol O₂/L·h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1 mmol O₂/L·h (dormant/stressed cells)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1 - 5 mmol O₂/L·h (active metabolism)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 20 mmol O₂/L·h (optimal activity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >20 mmol O₂/L·h (highly active biofilm)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Respirometry**:

   - Measure oxygen consumption in closed system
   - Record O₂ decline over time
   - Calculate specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR)
   - Units: mg O₂/g biomass·h

2. **CO₂ Evolution Measurement**:
   - Monitor CO₂ production rate
   - Use gas chromatography or IR sensors
   - Correlate with respiratory quotient
   - Indicates complete oxidation activity

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by biofilm volume or biomass
- Account for background respiration
- Consider dissolved oxygen limitations

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Concentration**:

   - Saturating conditions (>1 g/L): Maximum activity
   - Limiting conditions (<0.1 g/L): Reduced activity (50-80% of max)
   - Substrate type affects metabolic rate

2. **Temperature**:

   - Mesophilic optimum (30-35°C): Peak activity
   - Q₁₀ coefficient: 2-3 (activity doubles per 10°C increase)
   - Thermal stress >40°C reduces activity

3. **pH**:
   - Optimal range: pH 6.5-7.5
   - pH extremes (<5 or >9) reduce activity by 50-90%
   - Affects enzyme stability and membrane integrity

### Secondary Factors

1. **Dissolved Oxygen**:

   - Aerobic conditions: Higher total activity
   - Anaerobic conditions: Lower but sustained activity
   - Microaerobic: Optimal for some mixed communities

2. **Toxic Compounds**:
   - Heavy metals reduce activity (IC₅₀: 10-100 mg/L)
   - Organic toxins affect specific pathways

## Performance Impact

High metabolic activity correlates strongly with current density in MFCs. A
2-fold increase in metabolic activity typically results in 1.5-fold improvement
in power output. Biofilms with activity >10 mmol O₂/L·h generally achieve
current densities >5 A/m², while those <2 mmol O₂/L·h rarely exceed 1 A/m².

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 100 mmol O₂/L·h
2. **Unit consistency**: Standardize to mmol O₂/L·h or equivalent
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with current density
4. **Outlier detection**: >50 mmol O₂/L·h requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed theoretical maximum for cell type
