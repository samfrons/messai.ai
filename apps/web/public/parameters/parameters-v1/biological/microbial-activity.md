# Microbial Activity

## Definition

Microbial activity quantifies the metabolic rate and physiological state of
microorganisms in microbial electrochemical systems, typically measured as
respiration rate, enzyme activity, or ATP content. This parameter indicates the
health and functionality of the microbial community, directly affecting current
generation, substrate utilization, and overall system performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 10 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h (respiration rate)
- **Typical**: 0.5 - 5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h
- **Optimal**: 1 - 3 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h (low activity, stressed conditions)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.5 - 1.5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h (moderate activity)
- **High Performance**: 1.5 - 5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h (high activity, healthy
  community)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h (very high activity)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Respirometry**:

   - Measure oxygen consumption rate
   - Use dissolved oxygen probes
   - Calculate specific respiration rate
   - Indicates overall metabolic activity

2. **ATP Analysis**:

   - Extract and quantify ATP from biomass
   - Use luciferase bioluminescence assay
   - Indicates viable biomass fraction
   - Rapid assessment of activity

3. **Enzyme Activity Assays**:
   - Measure specific enzyme activities
   - Dehydrogenase activity common indicator
   - Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis
   - Indicates metabolic potential

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by biomass content (VSS or protein)
- Account for temperature effects
- Consider substrate availability
- Adjust for endogenous respiration

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:

   - Optimal temperature: Higher activity
   - Proper pH range: Maximum enzyme activity
   - Adequate nutrients: Support metabolism
   - Absence of toxins: Prevent inhibition

2. **Substrate Availability**:

   - Sufficient substrate: High activity
   - Limiting conditions: Reduced activity
   - Substrate type affects activity level
   - C:N:P ratio affects metabolism

3. **Microbial Community**:
   - Species composition affects activity
   - Age of biofilm influences activity
   - Acclimation state affects response
   - Stress history affects resilience

### Secondary Factors

1. **System Design**:

   - Mass transfer affects substrate access
   - Mixing influences nutrient distribution
   - Electrode potential affects activity
   - Flow conditions affect biofilm structure

2. **Operational Factors**:
   - Loading rate affects activity
   - Hydraulic retention time influences metabolism
   - Previous operating history affects state
   - Maintenance practices affect health

## Performance Impact

High microbial activity (>2 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h) indicates healthy, functional
communities capable of efficient substrate utilization and current generation.
Low activity (<0.5 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h) suggests stressed conditions, poor
performance, and potential system problems requiring intervention.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 100 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in μmol O₂/mg VSS·h or equivalent
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with current density
4. **Outlier detection**: >20 μmol O₂/mg VSS·h requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be within biological limits
