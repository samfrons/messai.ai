# Biofilm Age

## Definition

Biofilm age quantifies the time elapsed since initial biofilm formation or last
biofilm regeneration in microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter
reflects biofilm maturity, community succession, and functional development.
Biofilm age affects performance characteristics, stability, and maintenance
requirements, with distinct phases of development influencing system behavior.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 1 - 365 days
- **Typical**: 7 - 90 days
- **Optimal**: 14 - 60 days

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <7 days (immature, unstable performance)
- **Moderate Performance**: 7 - 21 days (developing biofilm)
- **High Performance**: 21 - 90 days (mature, stable performance)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 90 - 180 days (highly developed biofilm)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Operational Timeline**:
   - Record biofilm inoculation date
   - Track time since last disturbance
   - Monitor continuous operation periods
   - Document maintenance events

2. **Microscopic Analysis**:
   - Examine biofilm structure development
   - Assess maturation characteristics
   - Identify succession stages
   - Correlate with known development timelines

### Calculation Considerations

- Define start point consistently (inoculation vs stable attachment)
- Account for major disturbances or cleaning events
- Consider partial vs complete biofilm regeneration

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Optimal conditions: Faster development
   - Stress conditions: Slower maturation
   - Temperature, pH, nutrients affect development rate

2. **Substrate Availability**:
   - Abundant substrate: Rapid growth and development
   - Limited substrate: Slower development
   - Substrate type affects maturation rate

3. **System Disturbances**:
   - Cleaning events: Reset biofilm age
   - Flow changes: May disrupt development
   - Chemical shocks: Restart development

### Secondary Factors

1. **Microbial Species**:
   - Fast-growing species: Quick development
   - Slow-growing species: Extended development
   - Mixed communities: Variable development rates

2. **Electrode Material**:
   - Biocompatible surfaces: Faster attachment
   - Smooth surfaces: Slower initial development
   - Modified surfaces: Enhanced development

## Performance Impact

Biofilm performance typically follows development phases: attachment (0-3 days),
growth (3-14 days), maturation (14-60 days), and aging (>60 days). Peak
performance often occurs at 21-60 days, with potential decline after 90-120 days
due to overgrowth or aging effects.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 1000 days
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in days
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with biofilm thickness
4. **Outlier detection**: >365 days requires verification of maintenance history
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must have realistic development timeline
