# Mediator Concentration

## Definition

Mediator concentration represents the concentration of electron transfer
mediators (redox compounds) in microbial electrochemical systems that facilitate
electron transfer between microbial cells and electrodes. These mediators
include natural compounds like riboflavin, phenazines, and quinones, or
synthetic mediators like methylene blue and neutral red. Optimal mediator
concentrations enhance electron transfer efficiency while minimizing toxicity.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.001 - 10 mM
- **Typical**: 0.01 - 1 mM
- **Optimal**: 0.1 - 0.5 mM

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.01 mM (insufficient mediation)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.01 - 0.1 mM (basic mediation)
- **High Performance**: 0.1 - 0.5 mM (optimal efficiency)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 0.5 - 2 mM (enhanced systems)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)**:
   - UV-Vis detection at compound-specific wavelengths
   - Riboflavin: 280 nm, Methylene blue: 664 nm
   - Quantitative analysis with standard curves
   - Sample preparation: filtration and dilution

2. **Spectrophotometric Analysis**:
   - Direct measurement in solution
   - Monitor absorbance at peak wavelength
   - Account for matrix interference
   - Real-time monitoring capability

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for mediator degradation over time
- Consider bound vs free mediator fractions
- Correct for background absorbance

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Mediator Type**:
   - Natural mediators (riboflavin): 0.01-0.1 mM optimal
   - Synthetic mediators (methylene blue): 0.1-1 mM optimal
   - Phenazines: 0.001-0.01 mM effective

2. **Microbial Community**:
   - Mediator-producing species reduce external requirements
   - Pseudomonas produces phenazines (0.001-0.01 mM)
   - Shewanella produces riboflavin (0.01-0.1 mM)

3. **System pH**:
   - Affects mediator stability and redox potential
   - Optimal pH 6.5-7.5 for most mediators
   - pH extremes cause degradation

### Secondary Factors

1. **Temperature**:
   - Higher temperatures increase degradation rates
   - Optimal storage: 4°C, operation: 25-35°C

2. **Light Exposure**:
   - Many mediators are photosensitive
   - Dark operation recommended for stability

## Performance Impact

Optimal mediator concentrations can increase current density by 2-10 fold
compared to mediator-free systems. Power density improvements of 200-500% are
common with 0.1-0.5 mM mediator addition. However, concentrations >2 mM may
cause toxicity, reducing performance by 20-50%.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.0001 - 50 mM
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mM (millimolar)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with current density
4. **Outlier detection**: >10 mM may indicate toxicity
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by solubility constraints
