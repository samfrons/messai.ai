# Biofilm Conductivity

## Definition

Biofilm conductivity measures the electrical conductivity of the biofilm matrix
in microbial electrochemical systems (MESS). This parameter quantifies the
ability of the biofilm to conduct electrical current through its extracellular
polymeric substance (EPS) matrix and embedded conductive components such as
cytochromes, pili, and other electron transfer mediators. Higher biofilm
conductivity indicates more efficient electron transport through the biofilm
structure, directly impacting the system's power output.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.001 - 50 S/m
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 5 S/m
- **Optimal**: 1 - 10 S/m

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.1 S/m (poorly conductive biofilm)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.1 - 1 S/m (standard biofilm conductivity)
- **High Performance**: 1 - 10 S/m (enhanced conductivity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >10 S/m (engineered or optimized biofilms)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Four-Point Probe Method**:

   - Apply current through outer probes
   - Measure voltage drop across inner probes
   - Calculate conductivity using σ = I·L/(V·A)
   - Requires specialized microelectrode setup

2. **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**:
   - Apply small AC signal across biofilm
   - Measure impedance response
   - Extract conductivity from equivalent circuit modeling

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for biofilm thickness and coverage area
- Consider temperature effects (conductivity increases ~2-3%/°C)
- Correct for ionic conductivity of the medium

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Biofilm Thickness**:

   - Optimal range: 50-200 μm
   - Thicker biofilms may have reduced conductivity due to diffusion limitations
   - Very thin biofilms may lack sufficient conductive pathways

2. **Microbial Species Composition**:

   - Geobacter species: 5-30 S/m (highly conductive)
   - Shewanella species: 0.5-5 S/m (moderately conductive)
   - Mixed communities: 0.1-10 S/m (variable)

3. **Electron Transfer Mechanisms**:
   - Direct contact: Higher conductivity (1-50 S/m)
   - Mediated transfer: Lower conductivity (0.01-1 S/m)
   - Conductive pili networks enhance conductivity

### Secondary Factors

1. **pH**:

   - Optimal pH: 6.5-7.5
   - Extreme pH values reduce protein conductivity

2. **Temperature**:
   - Higher temperatures increase ionic mobility
   - Protein denaturation above 40°C reduces conductivity

## Performance Impact

Biofilm conductivity directly affects power density and coulombic efficiency in
MESS. A 10-fold increase in biofilm conductivity can result in 3-5 fold
improvement in power density. Systems with biofilm conductivity >1 S/m typically
achieve power densities >1 W/m², while those <0.1 S/m rarely exceed 0.1 W/m².

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.001 - 100 S/m
2. **Unit consistency**: Must be in S/m (Siemens per meter)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate positively with power density
4. **Outlier detection**: Values >50 S/m require verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed bulk metal conductivity (~10⁷ S/m)
