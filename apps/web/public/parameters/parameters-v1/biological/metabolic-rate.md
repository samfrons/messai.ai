# Metabolic Rate

## Definition

Metabolic rate quantifies the overall rate of cellular metabolism in microbial
electrochemical systems, typically measured as oxygen consumption rate per unit
biomass. This parameter integrates all metabolic processes including energy
generation, biosynthesis, and maintenance activities. Higher metabolic rates
indicate more active microbial communities capable of rapid substrate processing
and electron transfer.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 100 μmol O₂/mg·h
- **Typical**: 1 - 20 μmol O₂/mg·h
- **Optimal**: 5 - 30 μmol O₂/mg·h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1 μmol O₂/mg·h (dormant or stressed)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1 - 5 μmol O₂/mg·h (moderate activity)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 30 μmol O₂/mg·h (active metabolism)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >30 μmol O₂/mg·h (highly active)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Respirometry**:

   - Measure O₂ consumption in closed system
   - Clark-type oxygen electrode
   - Calculate rate: ΔO₂/Δt per mg biomass
   - Account for background respiration

2. **Warburg Manometry**:
   - Measure pressure changes due to gas exchange
   - CO₂ absorption with KOH
   - Classical method for metabolic studies
   - High precision for small samples

### Calculation Considerations

- Normalize by biomass (dry weight or protein)
- Account for temperature effects
- Consider endogenous vs substrate-driven respiration

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Concentration**:

   - Saturating substrate: Maximum metabolic rate
   - Limiting substrate: Reduced rate (20-50% of max)
   - Substrate type affects rate magnitude

2. **Temperature**:

   - Q₁₀ = 2-3 for metabolic rate
   - Optimal temperature: Peak rate
   - Stress temperatures: Reduced efficiency

3. **Growth Phase**:
   - Exponential phase: Highest metabolic rate
   - Stationary phase: 30-60% reduction
   - Maintenance metabolism in stationary phase

### Secondary Factors

1. **pH**:

   - Optimal pH: Maximum metabolic efficiency
   - pH stress: Increased maintenance costs
   - Extreme pH: Metabolic shutdown

2. **Nutrient Availability**:
   - Complete nutrients: Optimal rate
   - N or P limitation: 30-50% reduction

## Performance Impact

Metabolic rate strongly correlates with current generation capacity. Systems
with metabolic rates >10 μmol O₂/mg·h typically achieve 2-3 fold higher power
densities than those with <5 μmol O₂/mg·h. High metabolic rates indicate
efficient substrate conversion and active electron transfer processes.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 200 μmol O₂/mg·h
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as μmol O₂/mg·h
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with growth rate
4. **Outlier detection**: >100 μmol O₂/mg·h requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by enzyme kinetics
