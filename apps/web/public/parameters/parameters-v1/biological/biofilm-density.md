# Biofilm Density

## Definition

Biofilm density quantifies the dry mass of microbial cells and extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) per unit volume of biofilm in microbial
electrochemical systems. This parameter reflects the compactness of the biofilm
structure and directly influences mass transfer properties, electron transfer
efficiency, and overall system performance. Higher density typically indicates a
more mature, established biofilm with extensive EPS production.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 150 g/L
- **Typical**: 30 - 80 g/L
- **Optimal**: 40 - 60 g/L

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <20 g/L (sparse, immature biofilm)
- **Moderate Performance**: 20 - 40 g/L (developing biofilm)
- **High Performance**: 40 - 80 g/L (mature, active biofilm)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 80 - 120 g/L (dense, specialized biofilm)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Dry Weight Method**:

   - Carefully scrape biofilm from known area
   - Dry at 105°C for 24 hours
   - Weigh dried biomass
   - Calculate density: ρ = mass/(area × thickness)

2. **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**:
   - Non-invasive imaging of biofilm structure
   - Measure biofilm volume and mass distribution
   - Calculate local density variations
   - Real-time monitoring capability

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for residual moisture in "dry" measurements
- Consider spatial heterogeneity within biofilm
- Correct for inorganic precipitates in biomass

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Microbial Growth Phase**:

   - Exponential phase: 10-30 g/L
   - Stationary phase: 30-60 g/L
   - Mature biofilm: 60-100 g/L
   - Density increases with biofilm age

2. **EPS Production**:

   - High EPS producers: 60-120 g/L
   - Low EPS producers: 20-50 g/L
   - EPS comprises 50-90% of biofilm dry mass

3. **Substrate Concentration**:
   - High substrate (>1 g/L): 50-100 g/L density
   - Low substrate (<0.1 g/L): 20-40 g/L density
   - Substrate limitation reduces EPS production

### Secondary Factors

1. **Hydrodynamic Conditions**:

   - Static conditions: Lower density (30-50 g/L)
   - Moderate flow: Optimal density (40-80 g/L)
   - High shear: Compact biofilm (60-100 g/L)

2. **Temperature**:
   - Optimal temperature (30-37°C): Higher density
   - Suboptimal temperatures: Reduced density

## Performance Impact

Biofilm density significantly affects mass transfer and electron transfer
kinetics. Optimal density (40-60 g/L) balances high cell concentration with
adequate porosity for substrate diffusion. Overly dense biofilms (>100 g/L)
suffer from diffusion limitations, reducing inner layer activity and overall
coulombic efficiency by 20-40%.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 5 - 200 g/L
2. **Unit consistency**: Must be in g/L (grams per liter)
3. **Correlation checks**: Inverse correlation with porosity
4. **Outlier detection**: >150 g/L requires special verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed bacterial cell density (~1100 g/L)
