# Cell Doubling Time

## Definition

Cell doubling time is the time required for a microbial population to double in
number under specific growth conditions in microbial electrochemical systems.
This parameter reflects the growth rate and metabolic activity of the microbial
community, directly affecting biofilm development, substrate consumption rates,
and system startup time. Shorter doubling times indicate faster growth and more
rapid system establishment.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 2 - 100 hours
- **Typical**: 8 - 24 hours
- **Optimal**: 6 - 12 hours

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >48 hours (slow-growing, stressed conditions)
- **Moderate Performance**: 24 - 48 hours (standard growth)
- **High Performance**: 8 - 24 hours (good growth conditions)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <8 hours (optimal conditions)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Optical Density (OD) Monitoring**:
   - Measure absorbance at 600 nm over time
   - Plot log(OD) vs time during exponential phase
   - Calculate doubling time: td = ln(2)/μ
   - μ = specific growth rate (1/h)

2. **Cell Counting**:
   - Direct microscopy counts
   - Flow cytometry for accurate enumeration
   - Plate counting for viable cells
   - Track population increase over time

### Calculation Considerations

- Use exponential growth phase data only
- Account for lag phase duration
- Consider viable vs total cell counts

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Concentration**:
   - Saturating conditions: Minimum doubling time
   - Limiting conditions: 2-5x longer doubling time
   - Substrate type affects growth rate

2. **Temperature**:
   - Mesophiles: Optimal 30-37°C (6-12h doubling)
   - Psychrophiles: Optimal 10-20°C (24-72h doubling)
   - Q₁₀ = 2-3 for doubling time

3. **pH**:
   - Optimal pH 6.5-7.5: Fastest growth
   - pH stress increases doubling time 2-10 fold
   - Extreme pH may prevent growth entirely

### Secondary Factors

1. **Dissolved Oxygen**:
   - Aerobic growth: Faster doubling (4-8h)
   - Anaerobic growth: Slower doubling (12-24h)
   - Microaerobic: Intermediate rates

2. **Nutrient Availability**:
   - Complete nutrients: Optimal doubling time
   - N or P limitation: 2-5x longer doubling time

## Performance Impact

Cell doubling time directly affects system startup and recovery times. Systems
with doubling times <12 hours typically achieve stable operation within 1-2
weeks, while those >24 hours may require 4-8 weeks. Fast-growing communities (td
<8h) show better resilience to perturbations and faster power recovery.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.5 - 500 hours
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in hours
3. **Correlation checks**: Inverse correlation with growth rate
4. **Outlier detection**: <2h or >200h requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by cellular machinery constraints
