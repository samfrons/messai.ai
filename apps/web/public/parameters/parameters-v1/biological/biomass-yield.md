# Biomass Yield

## Definition

Biomass yield quantifies the amount of microbial biomass produced per unit of
substrate consumed in microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter
represents the efficiency of substrate conversion to cellular material and
affects both treatment efficiency and biofilm development. Biomass yield
influences system startup time, maintenance requirements, and overall
sustainability.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.01 - 0.8 g VSS/g COD
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 0.4 g VSS/g COD
- **Optimal**: 0.15 - 0.3 g VSS/g COD

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.1 g VSS/g COD (poor growth efficiency)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.1 - 0.2 g VSS/g COD (moderate growth)
- **High Performance**: 0.2 - 0.4 g VSS/g COD (good growth efficiency)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >0.4 g VSS/g COD (excellent growth)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Gravimetric Analysis**:

   - Collect biofilm samples at regular intervals
   - Dry samples at 105°C to determine total solids
   - Combust at 550°C to determine volatile solids
   - Calculate VSS (volatile suspended solids)

2. **COD Analysis**:
   - Measure substrate COD consumption
   - Monitor effluent COD over time
   - Calculate COD removal efficiency
   - Correlate with biomass production

### Calculation Considerations

- Yield = ΔBiomass (g VSS) / ΔSubstrate (g COD)
- Account for decay and maintenance energy
- Consider both attached and suspended biomass
- Normalize for system volume and retention time

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Type**:

   - Easily degradable substrates: Higher yield
   - Complex substrates: Variable yield
   - Toxic substrates: Reduced yield

2. **Environmental Conditions**:

   - Optimal temperature: Higher yield
   - Optimal pH: Maximum growth efficiency
   - Nutrient availability affects yield

3. **Growth Phase**:
   - Exponential phase: Higher yield
   - Stationary phase: Lower yield
   - Decay phase: Negative yield

### Secondary Factors

1. **Electron Acceptor**:

   - Different acceptors affect yield
   - Electrode potential influences growth
   - Oxygen availability impacts yield

2. **System Configuration**:
   - Biofilm vs planktonic growth
   - Surface area affects attachment
   - Flow conditions influence yield

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: Y = (X₁ - X₀) / (S₀ - S₁)

Where Y = yield coefficient, X = biomass concentration, S = substrate
concentration. Higher biomass yield (0.2-0.4 g VSS/g COD) indicates efficient
substrate utilization and good microbial health. Lower yield (<0.1 g VSS/g COD)
may suggest stress conditions or energy diversion to maintenance.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 1.0 g VSS/g COD
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in g VSS/g COD
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with growth rate
4. **Outlier detection**: >0.8 g VSS/g COD unusual for most systems
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by thermodynamic constraints
