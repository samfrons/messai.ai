# Substrate Uptake Rate

## Definition

Substrate uptake rate quantifies the specific rate at which microbial cells
transport and internalize substrate molecules from the surrounding medium in
microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter reflects the efficiency of
cellular transport mechanisms and determines the maximum rate of substrate
processing. Higher uptake rates enable faster growth and more rapid substrate
processing.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.01 - 10 g/g/h
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 2 g/g/h
- **Optimal**: 0.5 - 5 g/g/h

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.1 g/g/h (slow uptake, transport-limited)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.1 - 0.5 g/g/h (moderate uptake)
- **High Performance**: 0.5 - 2 g/g/h (fast uptake)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >2 g/g/h (very fast uptake)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Batch Uptake Studies**:

   - Add substrate to cell suspension
   - Monitor substrate disappearance over time
   - Calculate initial uptake rate: dS/dt per biomass
   - Use short time intervals to avoid growth

2. **Radioisotope Labeling**:
   - Use ¹⁴C-labeled substrates
   - Monitor substrate incorporation into cells
   - High sensitivity for low concentrations
   - Distinguish uptake from metabolism

### Calculation Considerations

- Use initial linear portion of uptake curves
- Normalize by active biomass concentration
- Account for extracellular enzyme activity

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Concentration**:

   - Follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics
   - Saturation kinetics: V = Vmax×S/(Km + S)
   - Higher concentration: Higher uptake rate (until saturation)

2. **Transport System Type**:

   - Active transport: Higher rates, energy-dependent
   - Facilitated diffusion: Moderate rates
   - Simple diffusion: Low rates, concentration-dependent

3. **Cell Physiological State**:
   - Exponential phase: Maximum uptake rates
   - Stationary phase: Reduced uptake capacity
   - Starved cells: May show enhanced uptake

### Secondary Factors

1. **Temperature**:

   - Q₁₀ = 2-3 for transport processes
   - Optimal temperature: Maximum uptake rate
   - Cold shock: Severely reduced uptake

2. **pH**:
   - Affects transporter protein function
   - Optimal pH for each substrate type
   - Extreme pH: Reduced uptake capacity

## Performance Impact

Substrate uptake rate determines the maximum substrate processing capacity and
influences system loading rates. Systems with high uptake rates (>1 g/g/h) can
handle higher substrate loads and achieve better treatment efficiency.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.001 - 50 g/g/h
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as g substrate/g biomass/h
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with growth rate
4. **Outlier detection**: >10 g/g/h requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by transport mechanisms
