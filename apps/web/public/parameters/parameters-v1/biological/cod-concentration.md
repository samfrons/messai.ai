# COD Concentration

## Definition

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration quantifies the amount of oxygen
required to chemically oxidize organic and inorganic matter in microbial
electrochemical systems. This parameter serves as a key indicator of substrate
availability, treatment efficiency, and system performance. COD concentration
directly affects microbial growth, current generation, and overall treatment
effectiveness.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 50 - 100,000 mg/L
- **Typical**: 500 - 5,000 mg/L
- **Optimal**: 1,000 - 3,000 mg/L

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <200 mg/L (insufficient substrate for optimal
  performance)
- **Moderate Performance**: 200 - 1,000 mg/L (moderate substrate levels)
- **High Performance**: 1,000 - 5,000 mg/L (optimal substrate range)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 5,000 - 10,000 mg/L (high substrate, may require
  management)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Standard COD Method (USEPA 410.4)**:

   - Dichromate oxidation in sulfuric acid
   - Colorimetric determination at 600 nm
   - High accuracy and reproducibility
   - Standard method for regulatory compliance

2. **High Range COD Method**:

   - For samples >1,500 mg/L COD
   - Modified reagent concentrations
   - Extended digestion time
   - Suitable for high-strength wastewaters

3. **Low Range COD Method**:
   - For samples <150 mg/L COD
   - Sensitive analytical procedures
   - Lower detection limits
   - Suitable for treated effluents

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for chloride interference in saline samples
- Consider volatile organic compounds escape
- Correct for turbidity interference
- Use appropriate dilutions for range

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Substrate Composition**:

   - Carbohydrates: 1.07 mg COD/mg carbohydrate
   - Proteins: 1.42 mg COD/mg protein
   - Lipids: 2.90 mg COD/mg lipid
   - Mixed substrates: Variable COD content

2. **Wastewater Type**:

   - Domestic wastewater: 200-800 mg/L
   - Industrial wastewater: 1,000-50,000 mg/L
   - Food processing: 2,000-20,000 mg/L
   - Synthetic substrates: Controlled concentrations

3. **Treatment Process**:
   - Influent COD determines loading
   - COD removal indicates efficiency
   - Effluent COD shows treatment quality
   - COD reduction affects power generation

### Secondary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:

   - Temperature affects oxidation rates
   - pH influences chemical oxidation
   - Presence of inhibitors affects measurement
   - Sample preservation affects results

2. **Analytical Factors**:
   - Reagent quality affects accuracy
   - Digestion time influences completeness
   - Sample dilution affects precision
   - Interference correction needed

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: COD Removal Efficiency = [(COD_in - COD_out) / COD_in] Ã— 100%

Optimal COD concentration (1,000-3,000 mg/L) provides sufficient substrate for
robust microbial activity and current generation. Low COD (<500 mg/L) limits
performance, while very high COD (>10,000 mg/L) may cause inhibition or mass
transfer limitations.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 10 - 500,000 mg/L
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mg/L or g/L
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with BOD and TOC
4. **Outlier detection**: >50,000 mg/L requires verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be realistic for wastewater type
