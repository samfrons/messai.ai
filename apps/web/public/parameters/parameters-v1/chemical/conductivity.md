# Conductivity

## Definition

Conductivity quantifies the ability of electrolyte solutions in microbial
electrochemical systems to conduct electrical current through the movement of
ions. This parameter is fundamental to electrical performance, affecting
internal resistance, power output, and energy efficiency. High conductivity
reduces ohmic losses and enables better system performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 200 mS/cm
- **Typical**: 1 - 50 mS/cm
- **Optimal**: 5 - 30 mS/cm

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1 mS/cm (poor conductivity, high resistance)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1 - 5 mS/cm (moderate conductivity)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 30 mS/cm (good conductivity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >30 mS/cm (excellent conductivity)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Conductivity Meter**:

   - Use standard conductivity electrode
   - Measure at controlled temperature (25°C)
   - Auto-temperature compensation available
   - Regular calibration with KCl standards

2. **Four-Electrode Method**:

   - Separate current and voltage measurement
   - Eliminates polarization effects
   - Higher accuracy for research applications
   - Suitable for wide conductivity range

3. **Inline Monitoring**:
   - Continuous process monitoring
   - Real-time data for control systems
   - Flow-through electrode design
   - Minimal maintenance requirements

### Calculation Considerations

- κ = G × K_cell where κ = conductivity, G = conductance, K_cell = cell constant
- Temperature correction: κ(25°C) = κ(T) × [1 + α(25-T)]
- Account for electrode fouling effects
- Calibrate cell constant regularly

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Ion Concentration**:

   - Higher concentrations increase conductivity
   - Linear relationship at low concentrations
   - Deviation at high concentrations due to ion interactions
   - Different ions contribute differently to conductivity

2. **Temperature**:

   - Higher temperature increases conductivity
   - Typical coefficient: 2-3% per °C
   - Affects ion mobility and dissociation
   - Standard reference temperature: 25°C

3. **Ion Type**:
   - Small, highly charged ions: Higher conductivity
   - H⁺ and OH⁻: Exceptionally high mobility
   - Organic ions: Generally lower conductivity
   - Ion size and charge affect mobility

### Secondary Factors

1. **pH**:

   - Extreme pH values increase conductivity
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ are highly conductive
   - Affects ion speciation and mobility
   - pH buffering affects total conductivity

2. **Dissolved Gases**:
   - CO₂ dissolution affects pH and conductivity
   - O₂ has minimal direct effect
   - Gas solubility affects ion concentrations
   - Degassing can change conductivity

## Performance Impact

High conductivity (>10 mS/cm) reduces solution resistance, improves power
transfer efficiency, and enables higher current densities. Low conductivity (<5
mS/cm) increases internal resistance, reduces power output, and limits system
performance.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 1000 mS/cm
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mS/cm or μS/cm
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with ion concentration
4. **Outlier detection**: >200 mS/cm unusual for most wastewaters
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be consistent with dissolved ion content
