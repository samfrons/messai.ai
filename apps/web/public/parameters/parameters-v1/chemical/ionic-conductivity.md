# Ionic Conductivity

## Definition

Ionic conductivity quantifies the ability of electrolyte solutions in microbial
electrochemical systems to conduct electrical current through ion transport.
This parameter directly affects internal resistance, power output, and overall
system efficiency. Higher ionic conductivity reduces ohmic losses and enables
better electrochemical performance, making it a critical parameter for system
optimization.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 100 mS/cm
- **Typical**: 1 - 20 mS/cm
- **Optimal**: 5 - 50 mS/cm

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <1 mS/cm (poor conductivity, high resistance)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1 - 5 mS/cm (moderate conductivity)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 20 mS/cm (good conductivity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >20 mS/cm (excellent conductivity)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Conductivity Meter**:
   - Use calibrated conductivity electrode
   - Measure at standard temperature (25°C)
   - Account for temperature coefficient
   - Regular calibration with standard solutions

2. **Four-Electrode Method**:
   - Use separate current and voltage electrodes
   - Eliminate electrode polarization effects
   - More accurate for research applications
   - Suitable for wide conductivity range

3. **AC Impedance Method**:
   - Apply AC voltage at appropriate frequency
   - Measure impedance and calculate conductivity
   - Separate ionic from electronic conduction
   - Useful for complex solutions

### Calculation Considerations

- κ = 1/ρ = G × (L/A)
- Where κ = conductivity, ρ = resistivity, G = conductance, L = length, A = area
- Temperature correction: κ(T) = κ(25°C) × [1 + α(T-25)]
- Account for electrode geometry and cell constant

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Ion Concentration**:
   - Higher concentrations increase conductivity
   - Relationship typically follows Kohlrausch's law
   - Saturation effects at very high concentrations
   - Different ions contribute differently

2. **Ion Type**:
   - Small, highly charged ions: Higher conductivity
   - Large, singly charged ions: Lower conductivity
   - Mobility differs significantly between species
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ have exceptionally high mobility

3. **Temperature**:
   - Higher temperature increases ion mobility
   - Typical temperature coefficient: 2-3%/°C
   - Affects both mobility and dissociation
   - Standard measurements at 25°C

### Secondary Factors

1. **pH Effects**:
   - Extreme pH increases conductivity
   - H⁺ and OH⁻ contribute significantly
   - pH affects ion speciation
   - Buffer systems affect total conductivity

2. **Ionic Strength**:
   - Higher ionic strength generally increases conductivity
   - Ion-ion interactions at high concentrations
   - Activity coefficients become important
   - Debye-Hückel effects at high concentrations

## Performance Impact

High ionic conductivity (>10 mS/cm) reduces solution resistance, lowers internal
resistance, and improves power output. Low conductivity (<1 mS/cm) increases
ohmic losses, reduces efficiency, and limits current density. Optimal
conductivity balances performance with cost and environmental considerations.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 1000 mS/cm
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mS/cm or S/m
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with total dissolved solids
4. **Outlier detection**: >100 mS/cm requires verification of concentration
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be consistent with ion concentrations
