# Alkalinity

## Definition

Alkalinity quantifies the acid-neutralizing capacity of water in microbial
electrochemical systems, primarily due to bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide
ions. This parameter indicates the system's ability to buffer against pH
decreases and maintain stable operating conditions. Higher alkalinity provides
better pH stability and system resilience to acid production.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 10,000 mg/L as CaCO₃
- **Typical**: 100 - 2,000 mg/L as CaCO₃
- **Optimal**: 500 - 3,000 mg/L as CaCO₃

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Alkalinity**: <200 mg/L as CaCO₃ (poor buffering)
- **Moderate Alkalinity**: 200 - 500 mg/L as CaCO₃ (moderate buffering)
- **High Alkalinity**: 500 - 2,000 mg/L as CaCO₃ (good buffering)
- **Very High Alkalinity**: >2,000 mg/L as CaCO₃ (excellent buffering)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Acid Titration Method**:

   - Titrate sample with standard acid (H₂SO₄ or HCl)
   - Endpoint at pH 4.5 or 4.3
   - Calculate alkalinity from acid volume consumed
   - Standard method (APHA 2320)

2. **Potentiometric Titration**:

   - Use pH meter for endpoint detection
   - More accurate than indicator methods
   - Can determine multiple alkalinity endpoints
   - Automated systems available

3. **Colorimetric Method**:
   - Use methyl orange or bromcresol green indicator
   - Visual endpoint determination
   - Less accurate but simple
   - Suitable for field measurements

### Calculation Considerations

- Alkalinity (mg/L as CaCO₃) = (Vₐₖᵢₓ × Nₐₖᵢₓ × 50,000) / Vₛₐₘₚₗₑ
- Where V = volume, N = normality
- Account for sample volume and dilution
- Temperature affects endpoint pH

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Carbonate System**:

   - CO₂ dissolution increases bicarbonate alkalinity
   - Photosynthesis removes CO₂, reducing alkalinity
   - pH affects carbonate speciation
   - Temperature affects CO₂ solubility

2. **Source Water Characteristics**:

   - Groundwater typically high in alkalinity
   - Surface water alkalinity varies seasonally
   - Wastewater alkalinity depends on source
   - Seawater has high natural alkalinity

3. **Biological Processes**:
   - Organic acid production reduces alkalinity
   - Ammonia oxidation consumes alkalinity
   - Denitrification produces alkalinity
   - Methanogenesis affects alkalinity

### Secondary Factors

1. **Chemical Additions**:

   - Lime addition increases alkalinity
   - Acid additions reduce alkalinity
   - Buffer additions modify alkalinity
   - Chemical precipitation affects alkalinity

2. **System Operation**:
   - Detention time affects biological impacts
   - Aeration affects CO₂ equilibrium
   - Temperature affects chemical equilibria
   - pH control affects alkalinity consumption

## Performance Impact

Adequate alkalinity (>1000 mg/L as CaCO₃) maintains stable pH during organic
acid production and prevents system acidification. Low alkalinity (<200 mg/L as
CaCO₃) allows pH drops that can inhibit microorganisms and reduce treatment
efficiency.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 1 - 50,000 mg/L as CaCO₃
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as mg/L as CaCO₃
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with pH and conductivity
4. **Outlier detection**: >20,000 mg/L as CaCO₃ exceptional for most systems
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be consistent with water source
