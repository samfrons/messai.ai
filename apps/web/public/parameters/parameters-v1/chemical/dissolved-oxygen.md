# Dissolved Oxygen

## Definition

Dissolved oxygen (DO) quantifies the concentration of oxygen dissolved in liquid
electrolytes of microbial electrochemical systems, typically expressed in mg/L
or % saturation. This parameter critically affects microbial metabolism,
electrode reactions, and system performance by influencing anaerobic/aerobic
conditions and cathode performance in air-breathing systems.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0 - 15 mg/L
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 8 mg/L
- **Optimal**: 0.1 - 2 mg/L (anode), 6 - 8 mg/L (cathode)

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >5 mg/L in anode (aerobic inhibition of electrogens)
- **Moderate Performance**: 2 - 5 mg/L in anode (mixed conditions)
- **High Performance**: 0.1 - 2 mg/L in anode (microaerobic conditions)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <0.5 mg/L in anode (strict anaerobic)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Electrochemical DO Sensors**:
   - Polarographic or galvanic sensors
   - Real-time continuous measurement
   - Good accuracy and response time
   - Require regular calibration

2. **Optical DO Sensors**:
   - Fluorescence quenching method
   - No oxygen consumption during measurement
   - Long-term stability
   - Suitable for low oxygen environments

3. **Winkler Titration**:
   - Chemical analysis method
   - High accuracy for reference
   - Discrete sampling required
   - Good for calibration verification

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for temperature effects on solubility
- Consider atmospheric pressure variations
- Account for salinity effects on oxygen solubility
- Use appropriate calibration standards

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **System Configuration**:
   - Single chamber: DO varies with location
   - Dual chamber: Separate anode/cathode control
   - Air-breathing cathodes: High DO near cathode
   - Submerged systems: Lower DO overall

2. **Biological Activity**:
   - Aerobic respiration consumes oxygen
   - Photosynthesis produces oxygen (if light present)
   - Biofilm respiration affects local DO
   - Microbial community composition influences consumption

3. **Mass Transfer**:
   - Air-water interface oxygen transfer
   - Mixing affects oxygen distribution
   - Flow rate influences oxygen transport
   - Gas sparging increases DO

### Secondary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Temperature affects oxygen solubility
   - Pressure influences saturation levels
   - Atmospheric oxygen concentration
   - Wind and surface agitation

2. **Chemical Factors**:
   - Chemical oxygen demand affects DO
   - Reducing chemicals consume oxygen
   - pH affects oxygen chemistry
   - Ionic strength influences solubility

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: DO saturation = (C_actual / C_saturation) Ã— 100%

Dissolved oxygen critically affects electrode performance. Anode performance
typically decreases with increasing DO due to competition with electrogenesis.
Cathode performance improves with higher DO for oxygen reduction reactions.
Optimal DO management balances these competing requirements.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 20 mg/L
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mg/L or % saturation
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with temperature and biological
   activity
4. **Outlier detection**: Values >15 mg/L unusual under normal conditions
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed saturation at given temperature and
   pressure
