# Redox Potential

## Definition

Redox potential (ORP - Oxidation-Reduction Potential) quantifies the tendency of
a solution to gain or lose electrons in microbial electrochemical systems,
measured relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. This parameter indicates
the oxidizing or reducing nature of the environment and affects microbial
metabolism, electrode reactions, and overall system performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: -500 to +800 mV vs SHE
- **Typical**: -300 to +200 mV vs SHE
- **Optimal**: -200 to +100 mV vs SHE

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <-400 mV (highly reducing, limited applications)
- **Moderate Performance**: -400 to -100 mV (moderately reducing)
- **High Performance**: -100 to +200 mV (balanced conditions)
- **Exceptional Performance**: +200 to +400 mV (oxidizing conditions)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **ORP Electrode**:
   - Platinum electrode vs reference (Ag/AgCl)
   - Direct potential measurement
   - Convert to SHE scale: E(SHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 197 mV
   - Continuous monitoring capability

2. **Potentiometric Titration**:
   - Titrate with standard redox couples
   - Plot potential vs titrant volume
   - Determine redox capacity and potential
   - More accurate for complex systems

### Calculation Considerations

- Use appropriate reference electrode corrections
- Account for temperature effects: -2 mV/°C typically
- Consider junction potential effects

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Dissolved Oxygen**:
   - High O₂: Positive redox potential (+200 to +400 mV)
   - Low O₂: Negative redox potential (-200 to 0 mV)
   - Anaerobic: Highly negative (-300 to -500 mV)

2. **Microbial Activity**:
   - Aerobic respiration: Increases redox potential
   - Anaerobic respiration: Decreases redox potential
   - Fermentation: Highly reducing conditions

3. **Chemical Composition**:
   - Oxidizing agents: Increase redox potential
   - Reducing agents: Decrease redox potential
   - Organic matter: Generally reducing

### Secondary Factors

1. **pH**:
   - Affects redox potential of many couples
   - pH increase: Generally decreases redox potential
   - Follow Nernst equation: E = E° - (RT/nF)ln([Red]/[Ox])

2. **Temperature**:
   - Higher temperature: Generally decreases redox potential
   - Affects equilibrium constants
   - Typical coefficient: -2 mV/°C

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: E = E° - (RT/nF)ln(Q)

Redox potential affects electrode potentials and available voltage. Optimal
redox conditions (-100 to +100 mV) provide balanced conditions for both aerobic
and anaerobic processes, maximizing metabolic flexibility and power output.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: -800 to +1200 mV vs SHE
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mV vs SHE
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with oxygen levels
4. **Outlier detection**: Values outside ±600 mV unusual for bioelectrochemical
   systems
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by water stability window
