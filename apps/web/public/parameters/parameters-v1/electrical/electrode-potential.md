# Electrode Potential

## Definition

Electrode potential quantifies the electric potential of individual electrodes
(anode or cathode) relative to a reference electrode in microbial
electrochemical systems. This parameter determines the thermodynamic driving
force for electrochemical reactions and affects overall system voltage and power
output. Proper electrode potential management is crucial for optimizing
performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: -800 to +800 mV vs SHE
- **Typical**: -400 to +400 mV vs SHE
- **Optimal**: -200 to +200 mV vs SHE

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: Potentials that limit current flow
- **Moderate Performance**: -300 to -100 mV (anode), +100 to +300 mV (cathode)
- **High Performance**: -200 to 0 mV (anode), +200 to +400 mV (cathode)
- **Exceptional Performance**: Potentials that maximize power output

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Reference Electrode Method**:
   - Use standard reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, SCE)
   - Measure potential difference with high-impedance voltmeter
   - Convert to SHE scale: E(SHE) = E(ref) + E°(ref)
   - Continuous monitoring possible

2. **Three-Electrode Setup**:
   - Working electrode (test electrode)
   - Reference electrode (stable potential)
   - Counter electrode (current flow)
   - Eliminates IR drop effects

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for liquid junction potentials
- Temperature correction: typically -2 mV/°C
- Consider activity coefficients in concentrated solutions
- Correct for IR drop in high-current conditions

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Electrode Material**:
   - Standard electrode potentials determine baseline
   - Surface treatments affect kinetics
   - Biofilm formation alters effective potential
   - Catalyst loading affects performance

2. **Electrolyte Composition**:
   - pH affects many redox couples
   - Ionic strength affects activity coefficients
   - Specific ions can shift potentials
   - Buffer systems stabilize potentials

3. **Biological Activity**:
   - Microbial metabolism affects local chemistry
   - Biofilm conductivity influences potential distribution
   - Metabolite production can shift potentials
   - Oxygen levels critically affect cathode potential

### Secondary Factors

1. **System Operating Conditions**:
   - Current density affects overpotentials
   - Temperature influences reaction kinetics
   - Flow rate affects mass transport
   - Pressure minimally affects potentials

2. **System Age and Conditioning**:
   - Electrode break-in period
   - Biofilm maturation effects
   - Catalyst aging or poisoning
   - Electrode surface modifications over time

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode - η_total

Where η_total includes activation, concentration, and ohmic overpotentials.
Larger potential differences between electrodes increase driving force for
current flow and power generation. Optimal electrode potentials maximize cell
voltage while maintaining sustainable current densities.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: -1500 to +1500 mV vs SHE
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in mV vs SHE (standard hydrogen electrode)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with redox environment
4. **Outlier detection**: Potentials outside water stability window require
   verification
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be consistent with thermodynamics
