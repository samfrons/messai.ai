# Internal Resistance (Cell)

## Definition

Internal resistance (cell) quantifies the total electrical resistance within a
microbial electrochemical cell, representing the sum of all resistive components
including biofilm resistance, electrode resistance, membrane resistance, and
solution resistance. This parameter directly affects power output, efficiency,
and overall system performance. Lower internal resistance enables higher current
densities and power generation.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 1000 Ω
- **Typical**: 1 - 100 Ω
- **Optimal**: 1 - 20 Ω

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >100 Ω (high resistance, poor performance)
- **Moderate Performance**: 20 - 100 Ω (moderate resistance)
- **High Performance**: 5 - 20 Ω (good performance)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <5 Ω (excellent performance)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**:

   - Apply AC perturbation across cell
   - Measure impedance vs frequency
   - Extract resistive components from Nyquist plot
   - Separate different resistance contributions

2. **Polarization Curve Analysis**:

   - Measure voltage vs current relationship
   - Calculate resistance from linear region slope
   - Determine resistance at different operating points
   - Simple but less detailed than EIS

3. **Interrupt Method**:
   - Suddenly disconnect external load
   - Measure voltage recovery vs time
   - Calculate ohmic and non-ohmic resistances
   - Useful for real-time monitoring

### Calculation Considerations

- R_internal = R_biofilm + R_electrode + R_membrane + R_solution
- Account for electrode area normalization
- Consider operating conditions during measurement
- Distinguish ohmic from non-ohmic contributions

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Electrode Properties**:

   - Material conductivity affects resistance
   - Surface area influences current distribution
   - Electrode spacing affects solution resistance

2. **Biofilm Characteristics**:

   - Biofilm conductivity varies with species
   - Thickness affects resistance
   - Hydration level influences conductivity

3. **Solution Conductivity**:
   - Ionic strength affects solution resistance
   - pH influences ion mobility
   - Temperature affects conductivity

### Secondary Factors

1. **System Design**:

   - Cell geometry affects current paths
   - Membrane properties contribute resistance
   - Connection resistance affects total resistance

2. **Operating Conditions**:
   - Current density affects resistance values
   - Temperature influences all resistance components
   - Aging affects component resistances

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: P = I²R_load / (R_internal + R_load)²

Lower internal resistance (<20 Ω) enables higher power output and efficiency.
Internal resistance should be minimized relative to external load resistance for
optimal power transfer. High internal resistance (>100 Ω) severely limits
performance.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 10,000 Ω
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in Ω (ohms)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with power output
4. **Outlier detection**: <0.1 Ω or >1000 Ω unusual for single cells
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be sum of component resistances
