# Shrinkage Rate

## Definition

Shrinkage rate quantifies the dimensional reduction of printed materials during
and after the manufacturing process for electrodes in microbial electrochemical
systems. This parameter encompasses thermal contraction during cooling, solvent
evaporation, polymer crosslinking, and other post-processing effects.
Understanding and controlling shrinkage is crucial for achieving dimensional
accuracy and preventing deformation.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 15 %
- **Typical**: 1 - 8 %
- **Optimal**: 0.5 - 3 %

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >10% (excessive shrinkage, poor control)
- **Moderate Performance**: 5 - 10% (manageable shrinkage)
- **High Performance**: 1 - 5% (controlled shrinkage)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <1% (minimal shrinkage)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Dimensional Comparison**:

   - Measure printed part before and after processing
   - Calculate: Shrinkage = (L₀ - Lf)/L₀ × 100%
   - Use calibrated measurement tools
   - Account for anisotropic shrinkage

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - In-situ measurement during processing
   - Video or laser measurement systems
   - Track shrinkage progression over time
   - Identify critical shrinkage phases

### Calculation Considerations

- Measure in multiple directions (X, Y, Z)
- Account for non-uniform shrinkage patterns
- Consider time-dependent shrinkage effects

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Material Composition**:

   - Polymer type affects shrinkage magnitude
   - Filler content reduces shrinkage
   - Solvent content increases shrinkage

2. **Processing Conditions**:

   - Print temperature: Higher T increases shrinkage
   - Cooling rate: Faster cooling increases residual stress
   - Curing conditions for photopolymers

3. **Part Geometry**:
   - Thick sections shrink more than thin
   - Complex geometries have non-uniform shrinkage
   - Constrained dimensions experience stress

### Secondary Factors

1. **Environmental Conditions**:

   - Humidity affects water-sensitive materials
   - Temperature fluctuations cause expansion/contraction
   - Aging effects over time

2. **Post-Processing**:
   - Heat treatment affects shrinkage
   - Chemical treatments may cause swelling/shrinkage
   - Surface finishing processes

## Performance Impact

**Formula**: ΔL/L₀ = α(T₀ - Tf) + βΔC + γΔX

Where α = thermal expansion coefficient, β = solvent sensitivity, γ = crosslink
density effect. Low shrinkage rates ensure dimensional accuracy and prevent
electrode deformation that could affect biofilm attachment and current
collection.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0 - 50 %
2. **Unit consistency**: Express as percentage
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with processing conditions
4. **Outlier detection**: >20% suggests processing problems
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot exceed theoretical limits
