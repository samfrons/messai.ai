# Pore Size

## Definition

Pore size quantifies the average diameter of pores in electrode and membrane
materials used in microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter affects mass
transfer, biofilm colonization, and overall system performance. Optimal pore
sizes balance substrate/product transport with biofilm attachment and structural
integrity.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.001 - 1000 μm
- **Typical**: 0.1 - 100 μm
- **Optimal**: 1 - 50 μm (for biofilm applications)

**Performance Categories by Application**:

- **Ultrafiltration Membranes**: 0.001 - 0.1 μm (molecular separation)
- **Microfiltration Membranes**: 0.1 - 10 μm (particle separation)
- **Biofilm Support**: 1 - 100 μm (microbial colonization)
- **Gas Diffusion**: 10 - 1000 μm (gas transport)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry**:
   - Force mercury into pores under pressure
   - Calculate pore size from pressure and surface tension
   - Provides pore size distribution
   - Most comprehensive method

2. **Gas Adsorption (BET)**:
   - Measure nitrogen adsorption isotherms
   - Calculate pore size from desorption branch
   - Good for micropores and mesopores
   - Standard method for surface area

3. **Microscopy Methods**:
   - Use SEM or TEM for direct visualization
   - Measure pore dimensions from images
   - Statistical analysis of multiple measurements
   - Visual verification of pore structure

### Calculation Considerations

- Use appropriate model (BJH, DFT, etc.)
- Consider pore shape assumptions
- Account for sample preparation effects
- Report mean, median, or modal pore size

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Manufacturing Process**:
   - Template removal creates specific pore sizes
   - Sintering temperature affects pore coalescence
   - Pressure and time affect pore formation
   - Chemical etching modifies pore structure

2. **Material Composition**:
   - Particle size affects initial pore structure
   - Binder content influences final porosity
   - Additives modify pore formation
   - Carbon content affects pore stability

3. **Processing Conditions**:
   - Temperature affects material behavior
   - Atmosphere influences chemical reactions
   - Heating rate affects pore development
   - Cooling rate affects final structure

### Secondary Factors

1. **Operating Environment**:
   - Chemical exposure may alter pore structure
   - Mechanical stress can deform pores
   - Biofilm growth may block pores
   - Cleaning procedures affect pore integrity

2. **Age and Use**:
   - Fouling reduces effective pore size
   - Chemical degradation alters structure
   - Mechanical wear changes surface
   - Biological activity modifies pores

## Performance Impact

Optimal pore size (5-20 μm) enables efficient mass transfer while providing good
biofilm attachment sites. Too small pores (<1 μm) may limit mass transfer and
prevent biofilm colonization. Too large pores (>100 μm) may provide insufficient
surface area and poor biofilm retention.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.0001 - 10,000 μm
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in μm or nm
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with porosity
4. **Outlier detection**: >1000 μm unusual for most applications
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be consistent with material structure
