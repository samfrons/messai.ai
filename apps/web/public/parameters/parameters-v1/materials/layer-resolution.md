# Layer Resolution

## Definition

Layer resolution refers to the minimum achievable layer thickness in additive
manufacturing processes used to create electrodes and components for microbial
electrochemical systems. This parameter determines the dimensional accuracy,
surface quality, and design complexity achievable in 3D-printed electrode
structures. Finer layer resolution enables more precise electrode geometries and
better surface characteristics.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 10 - 1000 μm
- **Typical**: 50 - 300 μm
- **Optimal**: 25 - 100 μm

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >500 μm (coarse layers, poor resolution)
- **Moderate Performance**: 200 - 500 μm (standard resolution)
- **High Performance**: 50 - 200 μm (fine resolution)
- **Exceptional Performance**: <50 μm (very fine resolution)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Optical Profilometry**:
   - Non-contact surface measurement
   - Step height analysis across layer boundaries
   - Statistical analysis of layer uniformity
   - Resolution: 0.1 μm vertical

2. **Cross-Sectional Microscopy**:
   - SEM or optical microscopy of cut sections
   - Direct measurement of layer thickness
   - Assess layer adhesion and uniformity
   - Destructive but highly accurate

### Calculation Considerations

- Measure multiple locations for statistical accuracy
- Account for layer compression during printing
- Consider shrinkage effects in final measurements

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Printing Technology**:
   - Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): 100-500 μm
   - Stereolithography (SLA): 25-100 μm
   - Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): 80-200 μm
   - Direct Ink Writing: 50-300 μm

2. **Material Properties**:
   - Viscosity affects minimum layer thickness
   - Surface tension influences layer spreading
   - Curing/solidification kinetics

3. **Process Parameters**:
   - Print speed: Faster speeds may increase thickness
   - Temperature: Affects material flow and curing
   - Layer adhesion requirements

### Secondary Factors

1. **Nozzle/Beam Size**:
   - Smaller nozzles enable finer layers
   - Laser spot size limits resolution in laser-based systems
   - Minimum feature size constraints

2. **Environmental Conditions**:
   - Humidity affects polymer materials
   - Temperature stability during printing
   - Vibration and mechanical stability

## Performance Impact

Finer layer resolution improves surface quality and dimensional accuracy of
printed electrodes. Electrodes with layer resolution <100 μm typically achieve
±25 μm dimensional tolerance, while those >300 μm may have ±100 μm variations
affecting performance consistency.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 1 - 5000 μm
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in μm (micrometers)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with printing technology
4. **Outlier detection**: <10 μm unusual for most 3D printing
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by material and process physics
