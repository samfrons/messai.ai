# Membrane Selectivity

## Definition

Membrane selectivity quantifies the ability of ion exchange membranes in
microbial electrochemical systems to preferentially transport target ions while
blocking others. This parameter is expressed as the ratio of target ion flux to
total ion flux or as permselectivity coefficient. High selectivity improves
separation efficiency, reduces energy losses, and enhances overall system
performance.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 0.1 - 1.0 (selectivity coefficient)
- **Typical**: 0.7 - 0.95
- **Optimal**: 0.85 - 0.98

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: <0.7 (poor selectivity, high interference)
- **Moderate Performance**: 0.7 - 0.85 (moderate selectivity)
- **High Performance**: 0.85 - 0.95 (good selectivity)
- **Exceptional Performance**: >0.95 (excellent selectivity)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Ion Chromatography**:

   - Measure ion concentrations on both membrane sides
   - Calculate flux ratios for different ions
   - Determine selectivity coefficients
   - High accuracy for multiple ion analysis

2. **Electrochemical Methods**:

   - Potential difference measurement across membrane
   - Calculate transport numbers for different ions
   - Use Nernst equation for selectivity calculation
   - Real-time monitoring capability

3. **Tracer Studies**:
   - Use isotopic or fluorescent tracers
   - Track ion movement across membrane
   - Calculate selective transport rates
   - Useful for mechanistic studies

### Calculation Considerations

- Selectivity = (Target ion flux) / (Total ion flux)
- Account for concentration gradients
- Consider membrane area and thickness
- Normalize for driving force differences

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Membrane Properties**:

   - Polymer backbone affects selectivity
   - Ion exchange capacity influences performance
   - Pore size determines size exclusion
   - Surface charge affects ion attraction

2. **Solution Composition**:

   - Competing ion concentrations
   - Ionic strength affects selectivity
   - pH influences membrane charge
   - Temperature affects ion mobility

3. **Operating Conditions**:
   - Applied voltage affects driving force
   - Flow rate influences boundary layer
   - Pressure affects convective transport
   - Current density impacts selectivity

### Secondary Factors

1. **Membrane Conditioning**:

   - Pre-treatment affects selectivity
   - Swelling degree influences performance
   - Aging affects membrane properties
   - Fouling reduces selectivity

2. **System Design**:
   - Membrane orientation affects performance
   - Flow configuration influences mass transfer
   - Cell geometry affects current distribution
   - Stack design impacts selectivity

## Performance Impact

High membrane selectivity (>0.9) minimizes unwanted ion transport, reduces
energy losses, and improves separation efficiency. Low selectivity (<0.7) leads
to poor separation, increased energy consumption, and reduced process
efficiency.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 0.01 - 1.0 (selectivity coefficient)
2. **Unit consistency**: Dimensionless ratio or percentage
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with membrane properties
4. **Outlier detection**: >0.99 requires verification of measurement
5. **Physical plausibility**: Limited by membrane material properties
