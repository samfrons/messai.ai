# Bed Temperature

## Definition

Bed temperature refers to the controlled temperature of the build platform or
print bed in additive manufacturing systems used to create electrodes for
microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter prevents warping, improves
layer adhesion, and ensures proper part formation during 3D printing. Proper bed
temperature is crucial for achieving dimensional accuracy and preventing print
failures.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 20 - 120 °C
- **Typical**: 50 - 80 °C
- **Optimal**: 60 - 70 °C (for common polymers)

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: Room temperature (poor adhesion, warping)
- **Moderate Performance**: 40 - 60 °C (basic adhesion)
- **High Performance**: 60 - 80 °C (good adhesion, minimal warping)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 80 - 100 °C (excellent adhesion, complex
  geometries)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Thermocouple Sensors**:
   - Embedded in build platform
   - Direct temperature measurement
   - High accuracy (±1°C)
   - Real-time monitoring capability

2. **Infrared Thermometry**:
   - Non-contact surface temperature measurement
   - Monitor temperature distribution
   - Account for emissivity of bed material
   - Useful for calibration verification

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for temperature gradients across bed surface
- Consider thermal mass effects during heating
- Monitor temperature stability during printing

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Material Type**:
   - PLA: 50-60°C (low warping tendency)
   - ABS: 80-100°C (high warping tendency)
   - PETG: 70-80°C (moderate requirements)
   - Conductive filaments: 60-90°C

2. **Part Geometry**:
   - Large flat areas: Higher temperature needed
   - Small parts: Lower temperature sufficient
   - Overhang features: Benefit from higher temperature

3. **Ambient Conditions**:
   - Cold environment: Higher bed temperature needed
   - Drafts: Increase warping risk
   - Enclosure temperature affects requirements

### Secondary Factors

1. **Bed Surface Material**:
   - Glass: Good thermal conductivity
   - Aluminum: Excellent thermal conductivity
   - Build surfaces: Affect adhesion requirements

2. **Print Speed**:
   - Faster printing: May require higher bed temperature
   - Slower printing: Heat has more time to dissipate
   - Layer time affects cooling

## Performance Impact

Proper bed temperature prevents warping and ensures good first layer adhesion.
Too low temperature causes poor adhesion and warping; too high temperature can
cause over-adhesion, making part removal difficult and potentially damaging the
print.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 15 - 150 °C
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in °C (Celsius)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with material requirements
4. **Outlier detection**: >120°C unusual for most polymers
5. **Physical plausibility**: Must be below material degradation temperature
