# CO₂ Concentration

## Definition

CO₂ concentration represents the amount of carbon dioxide present in the ambient
air surrounding microbial electrochemical systems. This parameter affects both
the internal CO₂ levels within the system and can influence microbial
metabolism, particularly for autotrophic processes. CO₂ concentration also
affects pH buffering capacity and carbonate chemistry in aqueous solutions.

## Typical Values

- **Range**: 300 - 5000 ppm
- **Typical**: 400 - 1000 ppm
- **Optimal**: 400 - 800 ppm

**Performance Categories**:

- **Low Performance**: >2000 ppm (poor air quality, potential toxicity)
- **Moderate Performance**: 1000 - 2000 ppm (elevated levels)
- **High Performance**: 400 - 1000 ppm (good air quality)
- **Exceptional Performance**: 400 - 600 ppm (optimal outdoor levels)

## Measurement Methods

### Direct Measurement

1. **Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) Sensors**:

   - Specific CO₂ absorption at 4.26 μm
   - High accuracy (±50 ppm)
   - Real-time continuous monitoring
   - Minimal interference from other gases

2. **Electrochemical Sensors**:
   - Chemical reaction produces electrical signal
   - Lower cost than NDIR
   - Shorter lifespan, requires calibration
   - Good for alarm applications

### Calculation Considerations

- Account for temperature and pressure effects
- Consider interference from other gases
- Regular calibration with reference gases

## Affecting Factors

### Primary Factors

1. **Ventilation Rate**:

   - Higher air exchange: Lower CO₂ levels
   - Poor ventilation: CO₂ accumulation
   - Natural vs mechanical ventilation

2. **Microbial Respiration**:

   - Aerobic metabolism produces CO₂
   - System loading affects CO₂ generation
   - Substrate type influences CO₂ production rate

3. **Building Occupancy**:
   - Human respiration adds CO₂
   - Equipment combustion processes
   - Indoor vs outdoor installations

### Secondary Factors

1. **Atmospheric Conditions**:

   - Outdoor CO₂ baseline (~420 ppm)
   - Seasonal variations
   - Urban vs rural differences

2. **System Design**:
   - Sealed systems: CO₂ accumulation
   - Open systems: Atmospheric equilibration
   - Gas purging and control systems

## Performance Impact

Elevated CO₂ concentrations (>1000 ppm) may affect air quality and worker
safety. Very high levels (>5000 ppm) can impact cognitive function and require
ventilation improvements. For microbial systems, CO₂ affects carbonate buffering
and pH stability.

## Validation Rules

1. **Range validation**: 200 - 50,000 ppm
2. **Unit consistency**: Express in ppm (parts per million)
3. **Correlation checks**: Should correlate with ventilation rates
4. **Outlier detection**: >10,000 ppm indicates poor ventilation
5. **Physical plausibility**: Cannot be below atmospheric baseline
